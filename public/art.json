This grouping is intended to suggest a quiet corner in an urban garden. Although the best-known garden rocks come from Lake Tai, near Suzhou, a number of other regions also produce handsome specimens. These rocks, for example, originated in Yunnan province in southwest China. The large rock in this grouping is said to have been retrieved from an abandoned Ming-dynasty (1368-1644) garden in Suzhou.\r\n\r\nGarden rocks are usually arranged to suggest a mountainous landscape, with a tall \"host\" peak flanked and buttressed by smaller \"guest\" peaks on either side. The Chinese fascination with rocks might be compared with the modern Western interest in abstract sculpture; although one can read meaning into both rocks and abstract sculpture, each is ultimately appreciated for the beauty of its form. In rocks, connoisseurs typically admire such qualities as attenuated proportions (that recall soaring peaks), weathered surfaces (that suggest great age), forceful profiles (that reflect the grandeur of nature), overlapping layers or planes (that impart depth), and hollows and perforations (that create rhythmic, harmonious patterns). Many of these same characteristics also inform Chinese landscape painting.\r\n","totaluniquepageviews":16,"exhibitioncount":7,"dimensions":"sight: H. 73 x W. 35.6 cm (28 3/4 x 14 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-06-26","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-12-17","dateend":1699,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

From the 1550s onward, the signature tomato red color and naturalistic motifs such as carnations, tulips, and cypress trees, as seen on this dish, started to emerge in Iznik ceramics and tiles, contributing to the creation of a classical Ottoman aesthetic. This was carried out under Kara Memi, the head of the imperial atelier in Istanbul, and represented a move away from the Persianate taste that permeated diverse Ottoman objects in the first half of the sixteenth century. Motifs borrowed from Chinese porcelains, such as the wave-and-rock border that runs along the rim of this dish, were also widely used in Ottoman pottery, attesting to the intercultural milieu in which Iznik wares were produced.","totaluniquepageviews":161,"exhibitioncount":8,"dimensions":"6.5 x 30 cm (2 9/16 x 11 13/16 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-09-16","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-05-14","dateend":1580,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

Unlike most of her contemporaries who made lithographs, Cassatt experimented with aquatint and softground etching techniques to make tonal prints. In these experiments, she worked closely with Degas and Pissarro. Their methods were new and untried, so only a few impressions were printed from each plate. Yet, these early prints are especially significant to her lifelong printmaking enterprise for they established her interest in and commitment to tonal etching. A pioneering 1890 exhibition of Japanese color woodblock prints at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts inspired Cassatt and her cohorts to begin printing in color, thus expanding the tonal possibilities of their prints. Cassatt's first efforts were a series of ten color etching and aquatints that appeared in her first solo exhibition at the gallery Durand-Ruel in Paris. In this series, Cassatt wanted to replicate the practice and appearance of Japanese woodblock prints produced from multiple blocks but she wanted to use copperplates instead. \"The Bath,\" sometimes called \"The Tub,\" is the first print from that series and simply depicts a woman and a naked baby beside a bathtub. \r\nIn order to print in color Cassatt needed to use more than one plate, and the final seventeenth state of \"The Tub\" is printed from two plates. In this final state, one plate carried the dry point lines and softground decoration, while the second plate carried the tonal areas that printed the colored inks. Along with the very fine impression of the final state, this group of prints includes seven proof states in which Cassatt was working out the necessary process for combining the lines and colored areas within the composition. Of particular note from this group is the forth state which was printed from only one plate. The subsequent proofs, which have overlapping lines and colors, are all printed from two plates. The proofs well demonstrate the experimental nature of Cassatt's printmaking practice--she prints on different color papers and variously leaves ink on the plate to create varying atmospheric areas of tone. The set reveals the ingenuity and diligence necessary to create the final version of the image.\r\nThese particular impressions of \"The Tub\" are historically significant as well. Cassatt kept them among her own \"studio collection\" which included hundreds of experimental proofs and unpublished prints. When she died in 1926, the collection went to her Parisian dealer Ambroise Vollard, who supplemented it by buying back Cassatt prints from her earliest collectors, including Degas. Upon Vollard's death in 1939, the prints were sold to another distinguished Parisian dealer, Henri Petiet, whose heirs began selling off parts of his collection after his death in 1980. The Cassatt prints were first offered through the New York print dealer Marc Rosen in 2000.

The inscription on this bowl is a compendium of the major decorative devices and themes that embellish these wares, including the dramatic elongation or extension of letters and their ornamentation with plaiting, arcs, loops, knots, foliate terminals, and interlacings that seem to spring from their middles or the ligatures between them.The most exuberant decorative devices occupy the upper zone of the inscription, that is, toward the center of the bowl. Underlying the proliferation of ornament is an essentially rhythmic structure based on repetition of near-identical elements. Occurring three times in the band, and dividing it roughly into thirds, is a complicated and additive form of the letter alif, the tallest element in the inscription. Each alif bears three loops on its staff and at its top deflects rightward in a foliate terminal. Its baseline stretches to the right and has been transformed into a split leaf, from which a tendril curls upward and rightward and terminates in another split leaf. The tendril in turn joins, or nearly joins, a curving and branching foliate outgrowth that reinforces the rhythm established by the alif. Less regularly spaced are three plaited ornaments that spring once from a ligature and twice from a closed rectangular letter. Small rosettes composed of four dots enliven the interstitial space of the inscription band and mark the center of the bowl. This bowl is well and thinly potted of a fine-grained earthenware. The exterior and interior are covered in a creamy white slip under a clear glaze. The flat and very slightly concave base is partially slipped and glazed. Only the interior is decorated; its brownish-black slip stands slightly raised above the surface, and a carving tool has been used to sharpen contours and to articulate the plaiting, twisting, and overlapping of the letters. The bowl has been reassembled from numerous fragments, with one notable loss on the rim.","totaluniquepageviews":15,"exhibitioncount":2,"dimensions":"8.6 x 25.5 cm (3 3/8 x 10 1/16 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-06-15","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-11-20","dateend":0,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

They then painted designs with different-colored slips and fired the whole under a transparent lead glaze. Among their finest works are the so-called epigraphic wares, which usually reproduce in angular Arabic script a range of benedictory phrases and popular proverbs. More rarely, as here, the vessels record examples of Hadith, that is, sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad and his companions. Beginning in his own lifetime, Muhammads conduct was considered an important guide.

Most surviving examples of this class of ceramics reproduce benedictory phrases or popular proverbs. More rarely, as here they record sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad and his Companions. Beginning in his own lifetime, Muhammads example was considered an important guide for how people should conduct their lives. In the early centuries of the Islamic era, sayings attributed to and anecdotes about him were collected and analyzed by numerous authors. The large andcomplex body of literature that resulted from this immense effort is known as hadith. The outer inscription on this bowl is written in black slip and records a saying attributed to the Prophet: Modesty is a branch of faith, and faith is in paradise. The inner inscription, in red slip, contains a similar dictum credited to 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, Muhammads son-in-law and the fourth orthodox Caliph of Islam: Greed is a sign of poverty. Because each inscription is written in a ring, the calligrapher inserted a single-word invocation to mark the beginning: in the outer circle, felicity, and in the inner one, health. This bowl has been reassembled from about fifteen fragments, with only minimal losses. The white slip and clear glaze completely cover the vessel, including its flat, slightly concave base.","totaluniquepageviews":629,"exhibitioncount":4,"dimensions":"9.6 x 26.9 cm (3 3/4 x 10 9/16 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-09-17","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-05-15","dateend":0,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

Pear-shaped ornament rising out of the last letter of the last word marks the end of the inscription. Written across the center is a single Arabic word, ahmad, which appears frequently on Samanid epigraphic bowls. In this context it is usually construed not as the signature of a potter but as a blessing: most praiseworthy. Proverbs praising knowledge and exhorting the owner to various forms of virtuous conduct appear frequently on these elegantly inscribed epigraphic wares, suggesting that they were appreciated by a class of users who placed high value on learning and ethical behavior.

A tall candle in a plaited metal candlestick illuminates the interior of the room, and a similarly ornamented ewer appears further to the right. The partially visible bow and arrows likely belong to the man and indicate his princely activities. The fish at the bottom of the scene and the flowers sprouting above the couple create a dreamlike ambience. A figure, likely a servant, stands at left, perhaps outside the room. Bordering the scene, a Persian inscription, reserved in white on a blue ground, is partially legible. Starting at the break on the left, it reads,\r\n. . . wings were broken.\r\n. . . from the prince, felicity came to me.\r\nEven if fate is not auspicious, give in to\r\nyour destiny. \r\nEight-pointed star tiles like this one were combined with other tiles of cruciform shape to create shimmering revetments for palaces and religious buildings. Although figural tiles were used in both secular and religious contexts, the intimate nature of the scene depicted here would have made this tile more appropriate for a palace interior.","totaluniquepageviews":228,"exhibitioncount":2,"dimensions":"23.2 x 21 cm (9 1/8 x 8 1/4 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-09-01","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-08-09","dateend":0,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

Royalist and in April, 1643 he escaped to France, taking his son with him. He returned the following year and thereafter \"submitted willingly to Government\". His son appears to have stayed on the Continent but he is recorded as staying with his grandmother, Lady Anne Clifford, at Skipton Castle in 1650. After this, he travelled \"in Italy to Rome and to other places abroad\". While his father appears to have made his peace with the Parliamentary side, his son was imprisoned in the Tower in 1655 and again in September 1656 to June 1658 on suspicion of being involved in Royalist plots.He married Elizabeth Boyle, 2nd daughter of Richard, 1st Earl of Burlington. His town house, Thanet House, escaped the Great Fire of London in 1666. Lady Thanet wrote to her mother on September 12, \"the nearest that it came to my house was Surgeon's Hall on the backside my garden, which is burnt down to the ground.\"The 3rd Earl died in 1679 but his widow lived to the age of 88 and died in 1725.

This bust of Antonia the Younger (36 BCE-37 CE)-daughter of Mark Antony, niece of Augustus, mother of Claudius, and grandmother of Caligula-is largely restored, but the head is original. Like many other imperial portraits, Antonia's image has been identified on the basis of its similarity to named likenesses on coins (compare no. 36 in the coin case behind this wall). This head shows her with the parted and waved hairstyle of the Augustan era, adorned only with a simple fillet. The primary intention was not to convey a physical likeness but to express virtues such as fertility, chastity, and piety. Despite the idealization, the subject is respectfully aged, suggesting that the head is based on an image created during the reign of Caligula or Claudius. The bust was formerly in Wilton House, home of the Earl of Pembroke, near Salisbury, England.\r\n","style":null,"datebegin":37,"imagecount":13,"description":"The bust was said to have been carved in Italian marble, but the head seems to be too crystalline and is therefore Greek, specifically Parian. The surfaces have been treated like most marbles surviving from the Renaissance, namely, the end of the hair at the back and the left shoulder were restored in Carrara marble. The remainder of the bust, the subject's right shoulder and lower left breast \"are also made of Parian marble, although unrelated to the head, and may possibly have been taken from another classical statue (i.e., another bust).\"\r\n\r\nAntonia was the daughter of Mark Antony, niece of Augustus, wife of Nero Drusus and mother of Claudius and Germanicus (born 36 BCE, died 39 CE). This portrait of the courtesy \"Empress (Augusta)\" in her later years parallels the numismatic likenesses struck in her memory by her grandson Caligula and her son Claudius (third and fourth emperors). The somewhat ideal presentation of a noble lady is based on a prototype probably created late in the reign of Augustus and known in other versions. Like Queen Elizabeth II on coins, she was not portrayed as aging as rapidly in art as in reality. As Erika Simon has observed in connection with a pair of marble busts of great sensitivity, Antonia and Augustus, such portraits were made late in the reign of Tiberius and until 39 CE under Caligula because Antonia Minor succeeded Livia as priestess of Divus Augustus in 29 CE (Simon, 1982, pp. 236-243, under nos. 166-167).\r\n\r\nThis replica of the mature likeness of the aristocratic matron Antonia is sometimes confused in the post-Renaissance and modern literature with the bust from the collection of the Hon. Robert Erskine. In the latter instance, however, the bust is entirely restored or, at least, alien (Sotheby Sale, London, 10 July, 1979, pp. 134-135, no. 284).\r\n\r\nCatalogue entry from: Stone Sculptures: The Greek, Roman, and Etruscan Collections of the Harvard University Art Museums; Cornelius C.

In his extended right hand is an offering bowl or patera. The ends of a crescent moon are visible behind his shoulders. The horse is shown with its left foreleg raised. It wears a simple bridle; there is a decorative band, perhaps part of a harness, across the chest, but no indication of a saddle. The horse's mane is wavy, in contrast to its tail, which is banded, and the hair of the god, which is depicted in straight strands in a style reminiscent of Alexander the Great. The statuette is rather stylized, with details like the eyes disproportionately large, and other details greatly simplified. Horse and rider are on a rectangular base, shown with a molded band at the top and bottom, perhaps in imitation of life-sized equestrian statue bases. The back of the statuette is relatively featureless, with only the folds of the cloak and details of the horse harness and statue base depicted.\r\n\r\nThe statuette is hollow and was made with a two-part mold; a circular vent hole is visible on the back.","totaluniquepageviews":31,"exhibitioncount":1,"dimensions":"17.2 x 10 x 3.4 cm (6 3/4 x 3 15/16 x 1 5/16 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-09-16","dateoffirstpageview":"2012-04-29","dateend":300,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

They are likely based on a statue in the theater at Athens, which showed him seated and was created around the time of his death by Kephisodotos and Timarchos, sons of the famous sculptor Praxiteles. While Greek portraits generally comprised the whole body (compare the Statuette of Demosthenes, 2007.221, in the case to the left), portraits of the Roman period took various forms, including the medallion or shield image (imago clipeata).

Individualizing features such as the close-set eyes and prominent cheekbones and brow indicate a strong personality. It has been suggested that the head might represent the emperor Macrinus. Praetorian prefect under the Severan ruler Caracalla, Macrinus assassinated the emperor and usurped the throne in 217 CE, only to have his own reign cut short. When the Severan dynasty was restored, the Roman Senate quickly declared Macrinus and his son enemies of the state and condemned their memories. Such official censure, called damnatio memoriae, typically resulted in the defacement of images of the condemned individuals and erasure of their names from public monuments.","style":null,"datebegin":217,"imagecount":5,"description":"This powerful countenance has a superficial resemblance to several portraits identified as the Emperor Macrinus (217-218 CE) or, possibly, a high official of around 243 CE. In the Harvard portrait, however, the forms are more solidified and the treatment of incised and sculpted hair is more pronounced and beautifully handled yet entirely devoid of life. This confirms a date near the last years of the Emperor Gallienus (260-268 CE) or even into the following decade.\r\n\r\nBoth quality and condition have given this Roman portrait public popularity and scholarly attention, as the long list of exhibitions monographs, and articles suggest. Professor Hanfmann discovered the head in the basement storage of Harvard's Busch-Reisinger Museum, lying among the large lot of medieval and other, mostly architectural fragments purchased in New York a few months previously at the epic, four-part sale of the famous dealer Joseph Brummer's stock. The head's debut was in the 1950 exhibition of Ancient Sculpture that Professor and Mrs. Hanfmann arranged with the graduate students in ancient art. Full publication came in Professor Hanfmann's Latomus XI monograph, where the portrait was placed in the time of Valerian or Gallienus (253-260, 260-268 CE). The catalogues of two major exhibitions, Rose Art Museum, Brandeis University, 1968-1969, and the Ackland Art Center, University of North Carolina, April 5-May 17, 1970, confirmed these dates, with minor variations. Vagn Poulsen in 1974 was the scholar who first mentioned Macrinus; the debate has continued and will do so.\r\n\r\nThe use of Luna or Carrara marble localizes the portrait in the Latin West, presumably Italy. As emperor (217-218 CE), Macrinus never came closer to Rome than Chalcedon on the Bosphorus where he was overtaken by the soldiers of Elagabalus (218-222 CE) and killed, but he did have an extensive Roman Imperial coinage, and so his image was available in Italy. All this throws smoke in the face of the fact that the Brummer-Harvard portrait combines a type of \"barbered head\" with \"plastic accentuation of each curl\" (of the lower beard) (noted by Charlotte Robl, Ackland Art Center, 1970) which can only belong to the decades of transition to the Late Antique. Although more sensitive in spirit than the numismatic portraits of Cludius II (268-270 CE), Aurelian (270-275 CE), or Probus (276-282 CE), tough soldiers all, similarities in hair and beard have led to the date proposed here. The subject was a private person, like the men of success and intellect represented on the big sarcophagi of the time.\r\n\r\nThe head is a badly battered masterpiece. Most of the nose, the areas of the eyes, the ears, and the lower part of the beard around the chin are missing or damaged. Where preserved, the surfaces are in excellent condition, characterized by the beautiful, high polish of the skin.\r\n\r\nCatalogue entry from: Stone Sculptures: The Greek, Roman, and Etruscan Collections of the Harvard University Art Museums; Cornelius C.

Loloi, Hafiz Master of Persian Poetry, A critical Poetry, New York, 2004, p.149). Only the first line of the poem is shown on the illustrated page and the rest of the poem can be found on the verso side.

The crispness of the relief is worn, making it difficult to determine whether the genitalia are covered by the drapery or are male. A roundel with bust decorates the horizontal end of the fulcrum.

The side walls of the fulcrum are of relatively even thickness, which suggests that they would have been applied as sheets of wax, perhaps directly over a preformed core. The inner surface reveals that the background of most of the fulcrum was also flat initially and that additional elements were added to this. The contours of the inner surface do not strictly conform to those of the outer surface, suggesting that many of the decorative elements were modeled directly onto the basic shape in the wax. The additional stepped decorative bands would have been added over the background. The distinct lip between the horses neck and the background suggests that the horse element was produced separately in wax and added to the wax fulcrum model. \r\n \r\nThe modeling and finishing was delicate and detailed. The horses individual teeth are delineated. Striations from finishing the piece after casting are visible in the outer grooves. The surface of the piece has, however, been altered overall by corrosion postules, perhaps malachite, some of which were removed during post-excavation cleaning, revealing pits of mineralized metal that are mostly cuprite. Due to the condition of the surface, it is impossible to detect tool marks and to make out some of the finer details, such as the nature of the decoration on the rim of the medallion or the object below the reclining figure. There are some losses due to corrosion, such as the tip of the horses proper left ear, the noses of both the female figures, and part of the back edge of the lower wall.\r\n \r\nThe overall patina is reddish brown with spots and postules of green. The tan material on the surface is a combination of burial material and wax; the surface must have been waxed during restoration. Traces of gold can be found in many areas of the outer surface, including on the figures and the background elements, which is evidence that the entire fulcrum would have been gilded. The inner surface preserves grayish-white and reddish-brown remains of core material. The horses head is filled with the terracotta-colored clay. \r\n \r\nAt least three nails were used to attach the fulcrum to the sofa. The rusty lumps of two iron nails can be found near the inner rim of the wall behind the reclining figure and in the wall behind the horses mane. Traces of a third nail can be found in the wall above the medallion with the bust. No organic remains or pseudomorphs from the couch to which this fulcrum attachment originally belonged are preserved on the fulcrum.\r\n \r\n \r\nTracy Richardson 4/6/1999 and Francesca G.

Handles or attachments to doors, vessels, or furniture, they make decorative use of the human form. Some of the personages are mythological: Neptune, a satyr, and a reclining Ariadne or Hermaphroditos. Stylized animals further embellish the decoration: Vittoria's door knocker pairs sea horses to form an arabesque, the handle of the Etruscan patera (libation bowl) has recumbent rams arranged like a calyx, and the upper end of the fulcrum attachment (headrest for a couch) terminates in a horse's head. The Eros may have adorned a vessel or light fixture. The pose of Neptune on the door knocker, which is reminiscent of Eros, reveals that sixteenth-century artists found inspiration not only in large, canonical masterpieces of the ancient world, but also in antique ornamental forms and small objects of daily life.\r\n","relatedcount":0,"datebegin":-100,"totaluniquepageviews":95,"dimensions":"18.4 x 22 x 5.6 cm (7 1/4 x 8 11/16 x 2 3/16 in.)","exhibitioncount":2,"dateend":50,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

Fur of mane and muzzle incised. Eyes inlaid with gold. Broadcloth incised. Chest is otherwise bare, deity wears an above-the-knee kilt. Both arms are bent at the elbow and the hands rest near the knees. Proper right hand is fisted, palm down, thumb extended. Proper left hand once held a staff (ankh) and is connected to the body with a support. The sides of the throne are incised with scenes enclosed with a geometric border. The piece is too damaged to make out the subjects of each scene. The scene incised on the proper right side of the throne includes an eye in the upper left corner of the field. Below the eye is a figure whose body is depicted frontally, but whose head, feet, and arms are turned to the right. The figure wears a tunic and skirt and holds aloft a bowl in both hands which s/he appears to extend toward the right. Unfortunately, the rest of the scene towards which the figure looks cannot be discerned. Below the figure, the bottom portion of the scene is covered by a repeated pattern of u-shaped incisions, of the sort often used to depict mountains. There are also scenes incised on the back of the throne and on the proper left side, but only bits of the geometric border can be discerned at present. Brown patina with bright green patches.\r\n\r\n1943.1121.B: Seated lion-headed figure (Sekhmet) (figure on right in image). Figure wears ankle length garment, broadcloth, and Uraeus crown. The crown consists of an incised cylinder to which is attached a flat, double-humped rectangular piece. A sphere surrounded by a flaring u-shaped roll deocrates the front of this raised part of the crown. The head of a uraeus extends from the cylinder, below the raised portion. The fur of the mane and muzzle is incised. The eyes may once have been inlaid with gold, now missing. Naked torso. Both arms bent at the elbow and rest near knees. Proper right hand extended, palm down. Proper left hand once held some sort of staff (ankh) and is attached to thigh by a support. Incised on the back of the throne is the image of a hawk enclosed by a box which is demarkated by a border. Below the hawk in a separate box demarkated by a similar border is an incised scene of a lion-headed figure in profile kneeling within an arch. The figure's outstretched hands grasp either side of the arch. Figure balances a sphere atop head. The figure kneels on a platform indicated by an incised line which balances atop a diamond. There is another incised scene on the side panel to the left of the base. The field is divided into two boxes demarkated by the same border as in the previous scenes, the lower of which is filled with a narrow geometric design. In the upper box is an incised depiction of the lion-headed figure sitting in profile upon a lotus flower from which extend seven smaller blooms from each side of the flower. The effect of these flowers is a lotus flower boat in which the lion-headed figure rides. The figure again balances a sphere atop her head. There are a few hieroglyphs in the upper right field. A similar scene decorates the side panel to the right of the base. The scene is again divided into two boxes demarkated by the same border. The lower box includes the same narrow geometric design. The upper box depicts a lion-headed figure in profile sitting in a similar lotus-boat. This time the figure wears the crown of upper and lower Egypt on her head, not a sphere. There is a hieroglyph in the upper left field. Green patina.

In Egypt, it reached new heights in the Third Intermediate period (c. 1070-664 BCE), when statues and statuettes were embellished with intricate inlays in precious metal or partly overlaid with gold. These two lion-headed deities may be assigned to the subsequent Saite period (c. 664-525 BCE). They served a votive purpose and might have contained sacrificed ichneumons (Egyptian mongooses). The female figure, identified by an inscription as the goddess Wadjet, wears a long dress and a crown composed of two tall feathers and a sun disk between cow horns; her throne is incised with a Horus-falcon and lion-headed figures. Most feline deities are female, but the other bronze, crowned by a cobra, is recognizable as male by the short kilt.

She stands with the weight on her right leg, her hip thrown outward to give the body a strong S-curve. Her cloak starts behind the neck, falls down her back, and is bunched in folds on a line around the right hip to the front of the torso, falling again over the left thigh. The other end is tucked under the left arm, making a diagonal fold across the back. This Aphrodite was wearing a diadem above her hair and, often, the part of her cloak that passed up behind her shoulders as a veil over the back of her head. Her left arm, with a bracelet on the upper part, was lowered and extended, probably once holding a marine attribute such as a stylized wave. Her right arm was bent and appears to have touched and held up the heavy folds of drapery on an extended right hip. The presence of the diadem favors the identification as a goddess born from the sea rather than a nymph of the ocean or water.","totaluniquepageviews":330,"exhibitioncount":2,"dimensions":"97.8 x 37 x 28 cm (38 1/2 x 14 9/16 x 11 in.)\r\n520 lb.","dateoflastpageview":"2014-09-15","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-06-15","dateend":50,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

Think of your own father, and pity me. . . . I have borne what no man who has walked this earth has ever yet borne: I have kissed the hand of the man who killed my son.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words in Book 24 of Homer's Iliad, the Trojan king Priam implores the Greek hero Achilles to let him ransom dead Hector. The scene on this hydria (water jar) is a dense visual rendering of the narrative. Hector's mutilated body is prominent; his wounds and tied ankles recall Achilles dragging the corpse behind his chariot. Just arrived, Priam clasps Achilles' knees in supplication and begins to speak. The reclining hero is startled; his big dinner knife and the now-faded strips of red meat hanging from the table lend him an air of brutality. At right, a suit of armor reminds the viewer of the events that led to the poignant encounter.","relatedcount":0,"datebegin":-510,"totaluniquepageviews":735,"dimensions":"38.1 cm h x 38 cm diam at handles (15 x 14 15/16 in.)","exhibitioncount":5,"dateend":-500,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

Numerous examples have been excavated at Seleucia on the Tigris and also at Babylon, mainly in the residential areas of these cities. The type may go back to Seleucid times, but its combination of Greek and Near Eastern features is characteristic of Parthian art, as well.\r\n\r\nThe statuette embodies the meeting of two artistic traditions. The nude, largely frontal representation of a woman follows the conventions established for Near Eastern images of female deities, such as Ishtar/Astarte. The reclining pose, on the other hand, is Greek. It was developed for male banqueters but also employed for certain female figures, such as Nereids lounging on sea creatures. This reclining woman may in fact have been shown at banquet, since several terracotta figurines with the same pose hold a cup in the left hand. \r\n\r\nThe significance of the alabaster and terracotta images of reclining women has to be sought in a local context and remains disputed. It has been suggested that they represented the goddess Anahita and were used as fertility charms (mainly for the alabaster statuettes) or, alternatively, that they were tomb offerings related to notions of the funerary banquet (for the terracotta figurines). However, male recliners are more rare and few statuettes seem to come from tombs.\r\n","style":null,"datebegin":-100,"imagecount":4,"description":"Small alabaster figure of a nude reclining woman, her legs, back, and proper left arm draped in a mantle.

The design is laid out in three registers: an Arabic word meaning harmony occupies the middle, and above and below it are long-necked birds with outstretched wings. Like the beginning and end letters of the inscription, the birds heads and leaf-like wingtips terminate at the red circular boundary. Freely painted running crescents and a black line enclose the lively composition. Combining Arabic script with birds became popular among potters in the early Islamic era. On this bowl, where inscription and birds are equally stylized and animated, the decorative formula has proved especially felicitous. Most of the black decoration on the bowl is painted in a relatively inert black slip. By contrast, the contour panels are dotted with a black pigment containing chromite, which stains the surrounding glaze light yellow. To date, ceramic vessels with yellow-staining black have been excavated only in Nishapur. The outside of the bowl is undecorated except for the white slip and clear glaze, which has a slight iridescence. The flat base is lightly covered in the slip and partially glazed.","totaluniquepageviews":302,"exhibitioncount":2,"dimensions":"5.8 x 18.8 cm (2 5/16 x 7 3/8 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-09-14","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-08-07","dateend":0,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

Modersohn-Becker lies at the roots of modernism in Germany. Her independent creative path offered a model for expressionist individuality (as did her themes of unspoiled, \"primitive\" nature), while her openness to advanced art from France (which she visited several times) was an important counterbalance to the currents of artistic chauvinism. Not only a cogent, persuasive comosition in its own right, this painting has evoked associations ranging from P.O. Runge (for the iconography of the massive child) to Joseph Beuys (for the ruddy brown palette).","relatedcount":0,"datebegin":1900,"totaluniquepageviews":159,"dimensions":"70.5 x 56.3 cm (27 3/4 x 22 3/16 in.)\r\nframed: 77.6 x 63.7 x 4.6 cm (30 9/16 x 25 1/16 x 1 13/16 in.)","exhibitioncount":0,"dateend":1910,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Busch-Reisinger Museum, Gift of Erich K. von Baumbach and Hubertus and Christina von Baumbach in honor of Hubertus Liebrecht","imagepermissionlevel":0,"signed":null,"century":"20th century","medium":"Emulsion (probably oil, tempera, and wax) on composite board","peoplecount":1,"accesslevel":1,"classification":"Paintings"},{"accessionyear":"1986","technique":"Struck","mediacount":0,"edition":null,"totalpageviews":2,"groupcount":0,"people":[{"birthplace":null,"name":"Caligula","prefix":null,"personid":19586,"role":"Coin Constituent","displayorder":1,"culture":"Roman","displaydate":"r. 37 - 41 CE","deathplace":null,"displayname":"Caligula"},{"birthplace":null,"name":"Agrippina The Elder","prefix":null,"personid":20159,"role":"Coin Constituent","displayorder":2,"culture":"Roman","displaydate":"r. c. 14 BCE - 33 CE","deathplace":null,"displayname":"Agrippina The Elder"}],"objectnumber":"1986.504.11","colorcount":0,"lastupdate":"2014-09-18T04:15:48-0400","imagecount":1,"description":"Obv.: Draped bust of Agrippina the Elder to r., her long hair tied and falling in a braid behind her neck.\r\nRev.: Carpentum drawn by two mules, the cover supported by two figures at the corners.","dateoflastpageview":"2014-06-24","dateoffirstpageview":"2014-02-07","primaryimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:COIN07271_dlvr","dated":"37 - 41 CE","contextualtextcount":0,"copyright":null,"period":"Roman Imperial period, Early","url":"http://harvardartmuseums.org/art/175509","provenance":"Glendining, Oc. 21, 1947, lot ; Glendining, Mar 25, 1957, lot 577","publicationcount":0,"images":[{"baseimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:COIN07271_dlvr","primarydisplay":1,"publiccaption":null,"copyright":"President and Fellows of Harvard College","renditionnumber":"COIN07271"}],"objectid":175509,"culture":"Roman","standardreferencenumber":"RIC I 2, 18 p.112","worktypes":[{"worktype":"coin"}],"department":"Department of Ancient and Byzantine Art & Numismatics","state":null,"markscount":0,"contact":"am_asianmediterranean@harvard.edu","titlescount":1,"id":175509,"title":"Sestertius of Caligula in the name of his mother Agrippina I, the Elder, Rome","verificationlevel":3,"division":"Asian and Mediterranean Art","details":{"coins":{"dateonobject":null,"metal":"AE","reverseinscription":"SPQR MEMORIAE AGRIPPINAE","dieaxis":"6","obverseinscription":"AGRIPPINA M F MAT C CAESARIS AVGVSTI","denomination":"sestertius"}},"style":null,"commentary":null,"relatedcount":0,"datebegin":37,"totaluniquepageviews":2,"dimensions":"28.73 g","exhibitioncount":0,"dateend":41,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

Avidly collected in Islamic lands, Chinese blue-and- white porcelain wares exerted enormous influence on Muslim potters of the fifteenth through the seventeenth century. Produced in northeastern Iran in the second half of the fifteenth century, this impressive dish combines decorative solutions developed during the reign of two dynasties in China. Antecedents for the wave and crest motif along the rim and the double scroll on the outside wall can be found in Yuan (12711368) blue-and- white\r\nwares, while the fleshy peonies in the center derive from Ming (13681644) prototypes. The curiously restless and asymmetrical nature of the interior composition results from the zones of the circle being divided into odd and even unitsthree peonies in the center, eight floral sprays along the wall, and six wave-and-crest motifs on the rim. Although the glaze has deteriorated somewhat, this dish is overall in fine condition. Put back together from a few large fragments, it has minimal losses.","totaluniquepageviews":38,"exhibitioncount":4,"dimensions":"7.8 x 43 cm (3 1/16 x 16 15/16 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-09-12","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-11-20","dateend":1480,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

The outside of the tea pot, hot water pitcher, sugar bowl and cream pitcher were composed of a very similar alloy. The inside of the lids of the tea pot and hot water pitcher had high levels of silver and mercury, indicating the use of mercury silvering to create a white metal surface.

Comparison of the two works confirms that the drawing has been trimmed, particularly at the left side, where the sitter's collar is rather conspicuously incomplete. Of considerable interest too is the translation, or rather mistranslation, of Vien's composition: although the print accurately reproduces the sitter's head and features, the folds of the sitter's cloak are noticeably more stylized and one-dimensional than in the drawing, which mitigates against the possibility of a counterproof serving as the intermediate design source for the etching. It is an example of the kind of print that was produced as a model for drawing students, who in the art academies were obliged to work from prints prior to being allowed to work from three-dimensional casts. These exercises preceded work from the live model that was the ostensible cause for the formation of art academies, and presumably the student not lucky enough to enter an academy or own casts would have to be content with prints such as this.","relatedcount":1,"datebegin":0,"totaluniquepageviews":29,"dimensions":"plate: 33 x 38.7 cm (13 x 15 1/4 in.)","exhibitioncount":0,"dateend":0,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Fogg Museum, Gift of Jeffrey E.

The battle between Greeks and Amazons, a mythical tribe of women warriors, was a common motif in Greek and Roman funerary art. It was favored for the many levels on which it could be read. It might suggest the deceased person's educated acquaintance with Greek legend. It could symbolize the struggle between order and chaos, represented by the Greek warrior and his ultimate other, the armed female Easterner. And it could allude to the fragile boundary between life and death. Created in Greece under Roman rule, this sarcophagus is in many ways a culmination of the funerary art of the preceding centuries.\r\n\r\nAdditional commentary:\r\n\r\nThe scene shows a battle between the Greeks and the Amazons. On the uppermost section of the sarcophagus a series of trophies with garlands and bulls heads are carved in low relief. The battling Greeks and Amazons with their horses are carved in varying degrees of depth. Some figures fall defeated on the ground while others brandish spears and swords. \r\n Two Greeks lie vanquished in the foreground of the front panel. On the left side one Amazon has succumbed to the battle while another struggles with her enemy and a third raises her hand as if to strike.\r\n On the front panel are eight horses, one of them lying dead, and on the left side is one horse. The horses rear on their hind legs, twist their necks, and struggle against their riders, contributing to the scenes sense of confusion. The composition is densely packed and the figures overlap.\r\n There are five sections, with pieces missing at the breaks. They run from the left end to the left front edge (or about so, with a section cut away), to the turn of the corner at the right front. The slabs look as if they had been cut and broken apart for use, face down, as paving stones. The visible surfaces are fresh, save where there is chipping.","style":null,"datebegin":175,"imagecount":4,"description":"Catalogue entry below from the publication: Stone Sculptures: The Greek, Roman, and Etruscan Collections of the Harvard University Art Museums; Cornelius C. Vermeule and Amy Brauer, Harvard University Art Museums, Cambridge, 1990:\r\n\r\nThe scene shows a battle between the Greeks and the Amazons. Sarcophagi with scenes of combat between Amazons and Greeks were carved in Italy, Asia Minor, and Attica. Those created around the quarries near Athens were the most satisfying in terms of classical Greek sculptures because, as especially here, they reflect the ideal scenes of combat going back to the Parthenon metopes, passing the era of the Bassae frieze with its Lapiths and Centaurs, and culminating in the friezes of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. Amazons were remembered for campaigns in Phrygia, Lycia, and an attack on Theseus at Athens, but the presence of Achilles and the dying Amazon Queen Penthesilea in Roman Amazonomachies suggest the focus was on the battle at Troy, when, late in the war, the Amazons came to aid their cousins Priam and the Trojans.\r\n\r\nA sarcophagus such as the Forbes-Gould-Harvard example, which once had a pedimented, temple-roof-shaped lid, would have appealed to a client in western Asia Minor because of its strongly Pheidian to Skopasian flavor. The combats could be thought of as symbolic of life's trials or the ravages of death (many other mythological sarcophagi combined similar themes). Otherwise, the Amazonomachy may have appealed to those persons, in Ionia or Italy, who cherished scenes from the Trojan War and, here, myths in which the Trojan ancestors of the Romans or their exotic allies were prominent.\r\n\r\nWhile looking back to Athens in the fourth century BCE in passages and specific details, this composition (the long side) with its crowded upper background, its foreshortened casualties in the bottom register, and its elongated combatants in the central area from end to end also looks ahead to Late Antique battle sarcophagi (the Ludovisi Sarcophagus in the Museo Nazionale Romano) when such unclassical elements will mark the beginning of the end of ancient art.\r\n\r\n","totaluniquepageviews":528,"exhibitioncount":4,"dimensions":"front: 63.5 cm h x 194 cm w (25 x 76 3/8 in.)\r\nside: 63.5 cm h x 59 cm cm w (25 x 23 1/4 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-09-13","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-05-19","dateend":225,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

Unlike most of her contemporaries who made lithographs, Cassatt experimented with aquatint and softground etching techniques to make tonal prints. In these experiments, she worked closely with Degas and Pissarro. Their methods were new and untried, so only a few impressions were printed from each plate. Yet, these early prints are especially significant to her lifelong printmaking enterprise for they established her interest in and commitment to tonal etching. A pioneering 1890 exhibition of Japanese color woodblock prints at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts inspired Cassatt and her cohorts to begin printing in color, thus expanding the tonal possibilities of their prints. Cassatt's first efforts were a series of ten color etching and aquatints that appeared in her first solo exhibition at the gallery Durand-Ruel in Paris. In this series, Cassatt wanted to replicate the practice and appearance of Japanese woodblock prints produced from multiple blocks but she wanted to use copperplates instead. \"The Bath,\" sometimes called \"The Tub,\" is the first print from that series and simply depicts a woman and a naked baby beside a bathtub. \r\nIn order to print in color Cassatt needed to use more than one plate, and the final seventeenth state of \"The Tub\" is printed from two plates. In this final state, one plate carried the dry point lines and softground decoration, while the second plate carried the tonal areas that printed the colored inks. Along with the very fine impression of the final state, this group of prints includes seven proof states in which Cassatt was working out the necessary process for combining the lines and colored areas within the composition. Of particular note from this group is the forth state which was printed from only one plate. The subsequent proofs, which have overlapping lines and colors, are all printed from two plates. The proofs well demonstrate the experimental nature of Cassatt's printmaking practice--she prints on different color papers and variously leaves ink on the plate to create varying atmospheric areas of tone. The set reveals the ingenuity and diligence necessary to create the final version of the image.\r\nThese particular impressions of \"The Tub\" are historically significant as well. Cassatt kept them among her own \"studio collection\" which included hundreds of experimental proofs and unpublished prints. When she died in 1926, the collection went to her Parisian dealer Ambroise Vollard, who supplemented it by buying back Cassatt prints from her earliest collectors, including Degas. Upon Vollard's death in 1939, the prints were sold to another distinguished Parisian dealer, Henri Petiet, whose heirs began selling off parts of his collection after his death in 1980. The Cassatt prints were first offered through the New York print dealer Marc Rosen in 2000.

Unlike most of her contemporaries who made lithographs, Cassatt experimented with aquatint and softground etching techniques to make tonal prints. In these experiments, she worked closely with Degas and Pissarro. Their methods were new and untried, so only a few impressions were printed from each plate. Yet, these early prints are especially significant to her lifelong printmaking enterprise for they established her interest in and commitment to tonal etching. A pioneering 1890 exhibition of Japanese color woodblock prints at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts inspired Cassatt and her cohorts to begin printing in color, thus expanding the tonal possibilities of their prints. Cassatt's first efforts were a series of ten color etching and aquatints that appeared in her first solo exhibition at the gallery Durand-Ruel in Paris. In this series, Cassatt wanted to replicate the practice and appearance of Japanese woodblock prints produced from multiple blocks but she wanted to use copperplates instead. \"The Bath,\" sometimes called \"The Tub,\" is the first print from that series and simply depicts a woman and a naked baby beside a bathtub. \r\nIn order to print in color Cassatt needed to use more than one plate, and the final seventeenth state of \"The Tub\" is printed from two plates. In this final state, one plate carried the dry point lines and softground decoration, while the second plate carried the tonal areas that printed the colored inks. Along with the very fine impression of the final state, this group of prints includes seven proof states in which Cassatt was working out the necessary process for combining the lines and colored areas within the composition. Of particular note from this group is the forth state which was printed from only one plate. The subsequent proofs, which have overlapping lines and colors, are all printed from two plates. The proofs well demonstrate the experimental nature of Cassatt's printmaking practice--she prints on different color papers and variously leaves ink on the plate to create varying atmospheric areas of tone. The set reveals the ingenuity and diligence necessary to create the final version of the image.\r\nThese particular impressions of \"The Tub\" are historically significant as well. Cassatt kept them among her own \"studio collection\" which included hundreds of experimental proofs and unpublished prints. When she died in 1926, the collection went to her Parisian dealer Ambroise Vollard, who supplemented it by buying back Cassatt prints from her earliest collectors, including Degas. Upon Vollard's death in 1939, the prints were sold to another distinguished Parisian dealer, Henri Petiet, whose heirs began selling off parts of his collection after his death in 1980. The Cassatt prints were first offered through the New York print dealer Marc Rosen in 2000. This set was purchased then but was recently returned to the dealer, thus becoming available to Harvard Art Museum.","relatedcount":0,"datebegin":1890,"totaluniquepageviews":16,"dimensions":"plate: 32.2 x 24.4 cm (12 11/16 x 9 5/8 in.)\r\nsheet: 43.6 x 30.1 cm (17 3/16 x 11 7/8 in.)","exhibitioncount":0,"dateend":1891,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Fogg Museum, Gift of Dr. Ernest G.

Starting out with a blue-on-white scheme, they added turquoise in the 1520s.

The figure, recognizable as Selim II with his drooping mustache from contemporary depictions, is seated on a throne under an arch and wears a ceremonial caftan with long sleeves lined with fur. His bejeweled belt, the red handkerchief attached to it, and his aigrette denote his imperial status. Moreover, his authoritarian pose and his way of tightly gripping the handkerchief point to his power as sultan. The inscription above the figure provides the sultans name and notes that he is the son of a sultan, thereby referencing his dynastic lineage. The checkered pattern bordering the painting and the marginal gilded floral decoration around it suggests that the painting was included in an album which was compiled by Kalender pasha (d. 1616) and commissioned by Sultan Ahmed I soon after 1610 and contained calligraphies, narrative scenes, drawings, paintings of single figures as well as the portraits of Ottoman sultans.","totaluniquepageviews":58,"exhibitioncount":3,"dimensions":"35.2 x 20.6 cm (13 7/8 x 8 1/8 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-09-15","dateoffirstpageview":"2010-01-06","dateend":1615,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

Fattorini, \"Matteo di Giovanni's 'St. Jerome' for the Notaries' Guild of Siena,\" in \"The Burlington Magazine\" 154 (1312) July 2012: pp. 468-475. Fattorini argues that the Art Museums' panel of Saint Jerome can be conclusively indentified as the work mentioned in documents of 1482 that record 4 payments made by the Notaries Guild of Siena to Matteo di Giovanni for an image of their patron, Saint Jerome, to decorate the interior of their headquarters in the city. This conclusion is based on stylistic grounds that link the Saint Jerome to other works known to have been commissioned by the Guild for their headquarters. \r\n2. Ibid., p. 470, a \"S. Girolamo figura quasi di grandezza al naturale, a pie' del quale è il nome dell'artista [Matteo di Giovanni]\" which can be associated with the Fogg panel is recorded in the Bellanti collection in Ettore Romagnoli's \"Biografia cronologica de' belleartisti senesi\" of 1835. Interestingly, the work is absent from the list of Bellanti works sold in 1838 to pay of the late Antonio Piccolomini's debts.","publicationcount":6,"images":[{"baseimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:74960_dynmc","primarydisplay":1,"publiccaption":null,"copyright":"President and Fellows of Harvard College","renditionnumber":"74960"}],"objectid":228297,"culture":"Italian","standardreferencenumber":null,"worktypes":[{"worktype":"painting"}],"department":"Department of Paintings, Sculpture & Decorative Arts","state":null,"markscount":0,"contact":"am_europeanamerican@harvard.edu","titlescount":1,"id":228297,"title":"Saint Jerome in his Study","verificationlevel":3,"division":"European and American Art","style":null,"commentary":null,"relatedcount":0,"datebegin":1492,"totaluniquepageviews":133,"dimensions":"sight: 163.4 x 118.2 cm (64 5/16 x 46 9/16 in.)\r\nframe: 184.5 x 136.4 x 12 cm (72 5/8 x 53 11/16 x 4 3/4 in.)","exhibitioncount":0,"dateend":1492,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Fogg Museum, Gift of Edward W.

The form of the lamp stand (1) dates back to Roman times and was spread throughout the Mediterranean region. This form continued into the Islamic era and was popular all over the Islamic world. The lamp and stand combination (2) is 5-6 centuries later than (1), but the basic shape is still the same. Elements of the new Islamic style can be seen in the generalised shape of the feet, as opposed to the realistic animal paws of the earlier stand; the more pronounced indentations of the base; and the faceted baluster shapes of the shaft. \r\n\r\nLikewise, the lamp portion of (1), which detaches from the stand, can be compared to (3), which is again 5-6 centuries later. The later lamp comes from Khurasan and has a type of base not seen in earlier lamps. Its body and handle, though, are clearly descended from Roman and Byzantine prototypes. By this time, the Byzantine cross has been transformed into an Islamic split palmette.\r\n\r\nThe bird-shaped lamp (4) has a very Islamic appearance, with its openwork braids and symmetrical incised decoration, but this shape can also be traced back to Byzantine prototypes. This particular example, which like (3) comes from Khurasan, also shows that Islamic metalwork was influenced by traditions found further to the east. The turquoise inlay of the eye (originally in both eyes) is an inheritance from Buddhist metalworking traditions in Kashmir, not far from the eastern boundary of the Islamic world. The Kashmiri metalworkers produced large amounts of Buddhist figural sculpture with inlaid turquoise or turquoise-colored glass paste for the eyes.\r\nNotes from the Glory and Prosperity exhibition, Feb - June 2002.","totaluniquepageviews":83,"exhibitioncount":5,"dimensions":"13.34 x 19.05 x 19.05 cm (5 1/4 x 7 1/2 x 7 1/2 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-09-16","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-10-21","dateend":0,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

Consuming undiluted wine was considered uncivilized: the habit of barbarians and of satyrs, the companions of the wine god Dionysos. Representations of satyrs-part human, part animal, and easily aroused-surround this vessel in a continuous procession. The frolicking is occasioned by Hephaistos's return, atop a mule, to Mount Olympos (note the satyr carrying the divine smith's bellows). This story illustrates the compelling power of wine, since it was Dionysos who persuaded the disgruntled Hephaistos to return-by making him drunk. The masterful drawing is from the hand of the Kleophrades Painter, a highly skilled but anonymous vase painter named after the potter whose products he decorated.","relatedcount":0,"datebegin":-505,"totaluniquepageviews":457,"dimensions":"43.8 cm h x 48 cm diam (17 1/4 x 18 7/8 in.)","exhibitioncount":6,"dateend":-495,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

Sackler Museum (1979.399, 1960.481, 1987.130, and 1998.101):\r\n\r\nExcept for the running Eros, these bronze objects are all utilitarian in function yet fanciful in appearance. Handles or attachments to doors, vessels, or furniture, they make decorative use of the human form. Some of the personages are mythological: Neptune, a satyr, and a reclining Ariadne or Hermaphroditos. Stylized animals further embellish the decoration: Vittoria's door knocker pairs sea horses to form an arabesque, the handle of the Etruscan patera (libation bowl) has recumbent rams arranged like a calyx, and the upper end of the fulcrum attachment (headrest for a couch) terminates in a horse's head. The Eros may have adorned a vessel or light fixture. The pose of Neptune on the door knocker, which is reminiscent of Eros, reveals that sixteenth-century artists found inspiration not only in large, canonical masterpieces of the ancient world, but also in antique ornamental forms and small objects of daily life.\r\n\r\nAdditional commentary:\r\n\r\nThis statuette of Eros represents the mischievous little son of Aphrodite hurrying along to some escapade or other. The forerunner of the Roman Cupid and the Renaissance putto, such Erotes became one the most beloved and versatile images of the Graeco-Roman artistic tradition. The torch may be a symbol of love, or perhaps this Eros is involved in a race with torches. The fine surface workmanship, the subtle modeling of his body and limbs, and his complex three-dimensional pose help us to place him as a product of the Hellenistic Greek sculptural imagination, perhaps produced in Greece, Asia Minor or Alexandria during the late third through the early first centuries BCE.\r\n(David Gordon Mitten, 2004)\r\n","relatedcount":0,"datebegin":-100,"totaluniquepageviews":102,"dimensions":"15.2 x 11.3 x 9 cm (6 x 4 7/16 x 3 9/16 in.)","exhibitioncount":2,"dateend":-1,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

The fur of the mane and muzzle is incised. The eyes may once have been inlaid with gold, now missing. Naked torso. Both arms bent at the elbow and rest near knees.

Incised on the back of the throne is the image of a hawk enclosed by a box which is demarkated by a border. Below the hawk in a separate box demarkated by a similar border is an incised scene of a lion-headed figure in profile kneeling within an arch. The figure's outstretched hands grasp either side of the arch. Figure balances a sphere atop head. The figure kneels on a platform indicated by an incised line which balances atop a diamond. There is another incised scene on the side panel to the left of the base. The field is divided into two boxes demarkated by the same border as in the previous scenes, the lower of which is filled with a narrow geometric design. In the upper box is an incised depiction of the lion-headed figure sitting in profile upon a lotus flower from which extend seven smaller blooms from each side of the flower. The effect of these flowers is a lotus flower boat in which the lion-headed figure rides. The figure again balances a sphere atop her head. There are a few hieroglyphs in the upper right field. A similar scene decorates the side panel to the right of the base. The scene is again divided into two boxes demarkated by the same border. The lower box includes the same narrow geometric design.

In Egypt, it reached new heights in the Third Intermediate period (c. 1070-664 BCE), when statues and statuettes were embellished with intricate inlays in precious metal or partly overlaid with gold. These two lion-headed deities may be assigned to the subsequent Saite period (c. 664-525 BCE). They served a votive purpose and might have contained sacrificed ichneumons (Egyptian mongooses). The female figure, identified by an inscription as the goddess Wadjet, wears a long dress and a crown composed of two tall feathers and a sun disk between cow horns; her throne is incised with a Horus-falcon and lion-headed figures. Most feline deities are female, but the other bronze, crowned by a cobra, is recognizable as male by the short kilt. The pierced hands of both statues once held attributes.","relatedcount":3,"datebegin":-664,"totaluniquepageviews":152,"dimensions":"67.8 cm h x 14 cm w x 26.7 cm d (26 11/16 x 5 1/2 x 10 1/2 in.)","exhibitioncount":2,"dateend":-525,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

While the identity of the man remains uncertain, it is tempting to think of him as Hermes, the messenger god who sponsored trade and cared for flocks.

Bes's head has small, flat cap-like top, large projecting relief ears, and beard cut off horizontally just below the chin. The top of the stele curves upward on either side to meet the Bes Head. A stepped relief element looking like the ends of a garment flank the head of Bes. The figural reliefs on the stele occur in two registers. \r\n\r\nThe upper register depicts a centrally placed nude male figure facing to the right, standing on a base carved with two small crocodiles. His head is covered with a closely fitting coiffeur or cap ending in a curl which in turn rests upon a curving feature around the neck that may be a pectoral. The figure grasps two serpents in each hand; with the right he grasps the head or horns of a small bovine figure, perhaps a goat or antelope. With his left hand he grasps a scorpion and a small lion by their tails in addition to the two snakes which rise symmetrically upward with their heads curved outward on either side. To the right of this figure stands a hawk headed deity, perhaps Horus. He grasps a waz scepter in his right hand and an ankh in his left. He wears a wig whose ends hand downward over a pectoral. He wears both the crowns of upper and Lower Egypt. A short belted kilt extends from the waist down to just above his knees. There is a streamer or tail-like tip of a belt that extends along the left leg all the way to the ground line. On the left side stands a goddess, feet together wearing a long tight garment that ends just above her ankles. She faces to the right toward the central standing figure. She wears a wig whose lock extends in relief from just below her ear to past her pectoral. A solar disc cradled in horns rises from a low platform on her head. There seems to be a uraeus (cobra) projecting from the top of her forehead. Her ear and frontal eye are carefully carved in relief. She holds an upright scepter with flairing tip in her left hand and an ankh held downward in her right. She may be the goddess Hathor.\r\nIntact. Sides and back marked by chisel cuts. \r\n\r\nThe lower register depicts two figures in relief facing each other rendered in much larger scale than those in the upper register. A block like projection from the ground line register extends downward in relief. It has been cut away on the right to outline the head and censer held by the right hand figure. The figures that face each other are the standing hippotamus goddess demon Tauert, protectress of women in childbirth. Tauert places her right paw on an upright curving object of unknown character. A pointed object appears to extend vertically upward from her paw. Her mane extends vertically all the way down her back and widens out into a tail whose pointed tip touches the bottom of the relief. To her right a male figure with left foot advanced stands before her extending in his left hand a censer with conical bowl for incense and handle that ends in a curved duck's head. His downward curving left arm holds what appears to be a stone vase with flat top and bottom. A lotus branch with open blossom appears to float in front of it. \r\n\r\nRising from the ground line is a stand with concave sides upon which rests an oval form that looks like an ostrich egg, a small snakehead projects from its upper left side. The offering man has an elongated, rounded bald head, carefully carved ear, frontal eye, nose and mouth. The top of his upper garment is carefully set off from this neck. A diagonal groove at the level of the hips suggests some kind of fastening at the middle of the body. A curving incised line descends to just below the knee to the garment covering the right leg. The skirt of the garment projects beyond the legs and ends in a horizontal line just above the ankles.\r\n\r\n(DGM)","totaluniquepageviews":46,"exhibitioncount":0,"dimensions":"28.2 x 15 x 4 cm (11 1/8 x 5 7/8 x 1 9/16 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-08-31","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-06-16","dateend":-100,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

Fra Paolino da Pistoia (died 1547) was Fra Bartolommeo's studio assistant and, according to Vasari and Lorenzo di Credi, his heir.\r\nSuor Plautilla Nelli, Convent of S. Caterina, Florence, Possibly acquired from Fra Paolina, 1547, Remained at the Convent of Santa Caterina, 1588. Suor Plautilla Nelli, Fra Paolina's pupil, entered the Convent of Santa Caterina in 1537. Fra Paolina must have given her the drawings before his death in 1547. The work remained at the convent until 1725.\r\nConvent of Santa Caterina da Siena, Piazza San Marco, Florence, Bequest from Suor Plautilla Nelli, 1588, Sold to Cavaliere Francesco Gabburri, 1725. Possibly from the convent. (Buyer: Cavaliere Francesco Maria Nicolò Gabburri)\r\nCavaliere Francesco Maria Nicolò (1676-1742) Gabburri, Florence, Purchased from Convent of S. Caterina da Siena, 1725, Sold by Gabburri's heirs, 1742. The landscape drawings were bound into an album c. 1730. The frontispiece of the album bore the coat of arms of Gabburri. The drawings were attributed at that time to Andrea del Sarto. For information on Gabburri see L. 2818, L. Suppl. 2992b. See also the preface to the Sotheby's sale catalogue of 1957 and Chris Fischer in the Rotterdam catalogue of 1990, pp. 12-17. Fischer postulates that the landscape drawings were not part of the 505 Bartolommeo drawings purchased by Gabburri from the Convent of Santa Caterina in Florence, but instead came from another source as they were not at that time recognized to be by Bartolommeo. This is credible as Lorenzo di Credi's inventory of the drawings given to Fra Paolino da Pistoia lists 830 loose sheets and 12 sketchbooks, but misses out 66 of the separate landscape drawings.\r\nWilliam Kent, London, Purchased from the heirs of Gabburri, 1742, Sold to private collector in England by 1768. Chris Fischer in the Rotterdam catalogue, 1990, p. 15, notes that some of the landscapes were copied by Robert Surtees, an amateur artist from Durham, in drawings dated 1768 and sold at Christie's in London on March 18, 1980, lot no. 6.The provenance identification of William Kent has been the subject of some dispute. Please see the article by John Fleming, \"Mr. Kent, Art Dealer, and the Fra Bartolommeo Drawings,\" \"The Connoisseur,\" vol. CXLI, 1958, p. 227. At the time of the 1957 sale it was assumed that the drawings were owned by William Kent, the architect. Fleming, however, noted that was far more likely that the works were obtained by his namesake, a dealer, who made extensive purchases in Italy for a number of English clients.\r\nPrivate Collector, Ireland, Purchase, 1925, Sold at Sotheby's, London, 1957. Sale, November 20, 1957, lot no. 4, repr. The private collector was identified as Sir Thomas Phillipps (subsequently his heirs) in \"An Exhibition of Old Master Drawings,\" New York/London (Richard Day), 1988, under no. 8.\r\nPrivate Collector, England, Probably acquired from William Kent, 1768, Unknown, 1925. Probably passed through a number of private Eng. collections until 1925\r\nSotheby's, London, Sold as \"The Property of a Gentleman\", sold to P. & D. Colnaghi, 1957. Sale, November 20, 1957, lot 4, repr.\r\nP. & D. Colnaghi & Co. Ltd., London, sold to Philip and Frances L. Hofer, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1958; bequest of Frances L.

Eighteen were etched by the artist himself, although the majority are engravings made by a variety of printmakers. This compilation of portraits of princes, politicians, soldiers, statesmen, scholars, art connoisseurs and most importantly artists, a survey of the most distinguished men and women of his time, went through many editions. The edition published by Martinus van den Enden during van Dyck's lifetime consisted of eighty portraits. Van Dyck prepared these prints by making oil sketches and drawings in black chalk, sometimes washed with brown ink. \r\n\r\nMany of these eighteen etched portraits by van Dyck are rare first state impressions, including the artist's Self-Portrait. The majority of the other eighteen are depictions of artists as well, including Jan and Pieter Brueghel, Lucas Vorsterman and Paulus Pontius-important reproductive engravers of Rubens's work, and Cornelis Anthoniszoon.\r\n","relatedcount":17,"datebegin":1621,"totaluniquepageviews":64,"dimensions":"platemark: 24.9 x 15.8 cm (9 13/16 x 6 1/4 in.)\r\nsheet: 26 x 17.3 cm (10 1/4 x 6 13/16 in.)\r\nframed: 57.8 x 47 x 2.5 cm (22 3/4 x 18 1/2 x 1 in.)","exhibitioncount":0,"dateend":1638,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Fogg Museum, Gift of Walter C.

Provenance research continues for this object, particularly since it was once in the Oskar Bondy collection which was confiscated in Vienna in 1938. The painting does not appear in the records of the Munich Central Collection Point from which many Bondy collection objects were shipped back to Austria and later returned by the Austrian government to the family. The painting was not included in the March 3, 1949 Kende Gallery, New York sale of restituted objects offered by Bondys widow, Elizabeth Anna. Mrs. Bondy, who died in 1974, also sold various works privately through Blumka Gallery and other dealers.\r\n\r\n2.

The artistic composition of this cinerarium, with its putti standing atop bucrania (bovine skulls) and bearing garlands, was borrowed from the decorative schemes of the sarcophagi then coming into vogue. The gabled lid originally belonged to a different urn. The Latin inscription reflects the Romanization of foreign-born slaves, the early age at which Roman women wed, and the traditional Roman ideal of eternal marriage. \r\n\r\nIt reads: \"To the manes (spirits of the dead) of Annia, daughter of Publius Isiadius, who lived sixteen years, two months, seventeen days. Publius Cornelius Mamertinus, freedman of Publius, a most unhappy husband, made [this tomb] for his sweet, faithful, and pious wife and for himself.\"","style":null,"datebegin":125,"imagecount":1,"description":"Two genii stand on stylized bovine skulls (bucrania), and hold the fillets of a garland that runs across the front, below the inscription plate that they flank. Two ravens perch on the garland, their heads facing inward. The lid has a wreath and long fillets in the pediment, with floral akroteria on the corners.\r\n\r\nThe translation of the Latin inscription reads: To the Manes of Annia who lives sixteen years, two months, seventeen days, daughter of Publius Isiadius. Publius Cornelius Mamertinus, freedman of Publius, a most unhappy husband made (this tomb) for his sweet, faithful and pious wife and for himself.\r\n\r\nThe design of genii, Amorini, or Erotes supporting the garland dates this urn in the Hadrianic or early Antonine periods (ca. A.D. 125-150) when garland-bearing children, with or without wings, were becoming standard on Roman sarcophagi.\r\nThe composition is found on only a few cineraria, which were carved at the time when coffins for the body rather than urns for the ashes were becoming popular in the Classical world. A damaged example at Fenway Court shows the Erotes perched on Roman Imperial eagles of apotheosis (Vermeule, C., Cahn, Hadley, 1977, p. 40, no. 54 and further parallels). See also the urn of Lucius Antonius Dionysius at Castle Howard in Yorkshire (Oehler, 1980, p. 55, no. 23, pl. 84).\r\n\r\nThe bucrania as symbols of death were increasingly popular in Hadrian's reign, being a prominent feature on the rectangular base of his own mausoleum beside the Tiber.\r\n\r\nThe urn is complete. Drillmarks are visible.\r\n\r\nCatalogue entry from: Stone Sculptures: The Greek, Roman, and Etruscan Collections of the Harvard University Art Museums; Cornelius C.

On the wall above Napoleon is a print of a seated Cossack about to place an extinguisher over a tiny and terrified Napoleon.\r\nBritish Museum","dateoflastpageview":"2014-09-17","dateoffirstpageview":"2010-06-01","primaryimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:DDC109385_dynmc","colors":[{"percent":0.3384126984127,"spectrum":"#e9715f","color":"#e1e1c8","css3":"#dcdcdc","hue":"Green"},{"percent":0.17993650793651,"spectrum":"#b55592","color":"#c8c8af","css3":"#c0c0c0","hue":"Green"},{"percent":0.08431746031746,"spectrum":"#3db657","color":"#4b644b","css3":"#556b2f","hue":"Green"},{"percent":0.072761904761905,"spectrum":"#8e5ea7","color":"#afaf96","css3":"#a9a9a9","hue":"Green"},{"percent":0.071174603174603,"spectrum":"#7866ad","color":"#7d967d","css3":"#808080","hue":"Green"},{"percent":0.050285714285714,"spectrum":"#2eb45d","color":"#323232","css3":"#2f4f4f","hue":"Grey"},{"percent":0.04768253968254,"spectrum":"#b65590","color":"#967d64","css3":"#808080","hue":"Brown"},{"percent":0.042920634920635,"spectrum":"#b25593","color":"#7d644b","css3":"#696969","hue":"Yellow"},{"percent":0.041777777777778,"spectrum":"#4fb94f","color":"#647d64","css3":"#696969","hue":"Green"},{"percent":0.034920634920635,"spectrum":"#59ba4a","color":"#644b32","css3":"#556b2f","hue":"Brown"}],"dated":"May 1 1814","contextualtextcount":0,"copyright":null,"period":null,"url":"http://harvardartmuseums.org/art/333527","provenance":"JB Neumann [between 1932 and 1961].

Thomas Hope (by 1842-1917), sold; [through Christies London, July 20, 1917, lot 68]; [to Arthur Tooth & Sons, Ltd., London, (1917-?)]. [Trotti et Cie, Paris (by 1923)]. [Richard Owen, Paris, sold July 1923]; to Samuel Sachs (1923-1942), gift of Mrs. Samuel Sachs; to Fogg Art Museum, 1942.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n1. According to Doris Wilds 1980 publication Nicolas Poussin, this painting has been incorrectly identified as having belonged to and possibly been painted for the Duc de Créqui. The author notes that Jean Pesnes 1678 engraving after the painting lists the work as being in the collection of Jean Froment de Veine. According to the Créqui collection inventory, however, the Créqui Holy Family was still in the Ducs collection upon his death in 1687 (inventory no. 168). Hence the author concludes that the Fogg painting is not the one which was once in the Créqui collection. For further discussion about the painting and the Créqui and Veine collections, see Anthony Blunts 1966 Paintings of Nicolas Poussin and Pierre Rosenbergs 1982 exhibition catalogue France in the Golden Age.\r\n\r\n2. According to lot 10 of the Mariette, Paris, April 14, 1750 D Hariague sale, the work was painted by Poussin for Formont [sic] de Veine. \r\n\r\n3. According to Pierre Rosenbergs 1994 catalogue Nicolas Poussin 1594-1665, the painting was purchased by Michael Bryan at the May 11, 1801 Paillet sale in Paris and then sold to George Hibbert in London on November 6, 1809 (cat. 22). In volume 4 of the Cleveland Studies in the History of Art associated with the 1999 Poussin exhibition, Bryant is again listed as selling the work to Hibbert on November 6, 1809 (lot 22). Other sources, including Anthony Blunts 1966 Paintings of Nicolas Poussin and Pierre Rosenbergs 1982 exhibition catalogue France in the Golden Age, only state that Bryan purchased the painting at the Paillet sale but do not mention the 1809 sale. Further information about the November 6, 1809 sale was not found, and thus while it is clear that Bryant sold the work to George Hibbert, the November 6, 1809 sale information remains unconfirmed.\r\n\r\n4. Per Christies London the painting was bought at the July 20, 1917 sale by Arthur Tooth & Sons, Ltd., London. \r\n\r\n","publicationcount":18,"images":[{"baseimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:30074_dynmc","primarydisplay":1,"publiccaption":null,"copyright":"President and Fellows of Harvard College","renditionnumber":"30074"},{"baseimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:VRS19134_dynmc","primarydisplay":0,"publiccaption":null,"copyright":"President and Fellows of Harvard College","renditionnumber":"19134"}],"objectid":299861,"culture":"French","standardreferencenumber":null,"worktypes":[{"worktype":"painting"}],"department":"Department of Paintings, Sculpture & Decorative Arts","state":null,"markscount":0,"contact":"am_europeanamerican@harvard.edu","titlescount":1,"id":299861,"title":"The Holy Family with the Infant Saint John the Baptist and Saint Elizabeth","verificationlevel":3,"division":"European and American Art","style":null,"commentary":null,"relatedcount":2,"datebegin":1650,"totaluniquepageviews":474,"dimensions":"99.9 x 132.4 cm (39 5/16 x 52 1/8 in.)\r\nframe: 129.5 x 162 cm (51 x 63 3/4 in.)","exhibitioncount":7,"dateend":1651,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Fogg Museum, Gift of Mrs. Samuel Sachs in memory of her husband, Samuel Sachs","imagepermissionlevel":0,"signed":null,"century":"17th century","medium":"Oil on canvas","peoplecount":1,"accesslevel":1,"classification":"Paintings"},{"accessionyear":"1951","technique":null,"mediacount":0,"edition":null,"totalpageviews":2428,"groupcount":1,"people":[{"birthplace":"Malaga, Spain","name":"Pablo Ruiz Picasso","prefix":null,"personid":28064,"role":"Artist","displayorder":1,"culture":"Spanish","displaydate":"1881 - 1973","deathplace":"Mougins, France","displayname":"Pablo Ruiz Picasso"}],"objectnumber":"1951.57","colorcount":10,"lastupdate":"2014-09-18T04:17:35-0400","imagecount":4,"description":null,"dateoflastpageview":"2014-09-17","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-05-12","primaryimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:DDC231461_dynmc","colors":[{"percent":0.27932816537468,"spectrum":"#00929e","color":"#19324b","css3":"#2f4f4f","hue":"Blue"},{"percent":0.20325581395349,"spectrum":"#4072b8","color":"#32647d","css3":"#483d8b","hue":"Blue"},{"percent":0.14847545219638,"spectrum":"#536fb5","color":"#4b7d96","css3":"#4682b4","hue":"Blue"},{"percent":0.090180878552972,"spectrum":"#00929e","color":"#004b64","css3":"#2f4f4f","hue":"Green"},{"percent":0.077519379844961,"spectrum":"#6c6ab0","color":"#647d7d","css3":"#708090","hue":"Blue"},{"percent":0.049457364341085,"spectrum":"#1eb264","color":"#191932","css3":"#000000","hue":"Blue"},{"percent":0.047751937984496,"spectrum":"#4072b8","color":"#324b64","css3":"#2f4f4f","hue":"Blue"},{"percent":0.041188630490956,"spectrum":"#3db657","color":"#4b4b4b","css3":"#2f4f4f","hue":"Grey"},{"percent":0.029354005167959,"spectrum":"#8e5ea7","color":"#96967d","css3":"#808080","hue":"Green"},{"percent":0.017002583979328,"spectrum":"#b55592","color":"#c8c8af","css3":"#c0c0c0","hue":"Green"}],"dated":"c. 1901","contextualtextcount":0,"copyright":"© Estate of Pablo Picasso / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York","period":null,"url":"http://harvardartmuseums.org/art/299993","provenance":"Pablo Ruiz Picasso, Painted, 1901, to Ambroise Vollard.\r\nAmbroise Vollard, Paris, from the artist?.\r\nJohn Quinn, New York NY, purchased through Carroll Galleries, 1924.\r\nPaul Rosenberg, Paris, from estate of John Quinn.\r\nBaron Shigetaro Fukushima, Paris, Purchased from a Paris Gallery, 1926, Sale, 1933 or before, 1933.

The presence of a boar's head by the left foot and, seemingly, a hound at the subject's right side, plus the relationship to Skopas's sculptures for the temple of Tegea, have given rise to the identification of the subject as Meleager, hunter of the Calydonian boar, and the sculptor as Skopas. \r\n\r\nWhile the original and its numerous, variant copies all show an ideal hero and have nothing to do with Greek portraiture, a head from a statue, now at Houghton Hall in Norfolk, was carved as a likeness of a Hellenistic ruler, surely a Seleucid. The marble was a copy of the Antonine period after an original based on Skopas's statue (Oehler, 1980, p. 73, no. 66, pl. 22). \r\n\r\nAlong with the head and torso of the statue as rejoined (most recently in 1961-1962) came eighteen fragments that may belong to the base (Hanfmann, Pedley, 1964, p. 62). Three fragments joined to form the hero's lower leg. Another fragment is part of the thigh. Two fragments seem to have been parts of Meleager's dog and boar's head and three fragments joined to form what might have been part of the stick(?) on which Meleager leaned and part of a chlamys falling down the left arm. \r\n\r\nThe chief difference in the Harvard copy and its mate from Santa Marinella in Berlin, one of the touchstones for the group of copies, is that the javelin held in the left hand has been replaced by a staff lodged under the left arm. The feeling is that both the boar's head and the dog were part of the original composition in bronze, the latter beside the hero's right leg and the former by his left foot.\r\n\r\nWhile the more slender and youthful \"boy victor\" (Narcissus) after Polykleitos could be identified as Adonis when a boar's head was added to the support on which the lad leaned, there is no question here that the more mature, more formidable figure of Meleager was intended, not the least reason being that a Meleager based on this Skopasian statue appears frequently as the protagonist on sarcophagi.\r\n\r\nCatalogue entry from: Stone Sculptures: The Greek, Roman, and Etruscan Collections of the Harvard University Art Museums; Cornelius C.

It likely represents Meleager, the legendary hunter of the Calydonian boar and suitor of the Arcadian heroine Atalanta. Other copies preserve a boar's head by the feet. Greek sculptors excelled in shaping the nude bodies of gods, heroes, and athletes. The forceful body and emotional features of Meleager recall the sculptures from the temple of Athena Alea at Tegea in Arcadia, which included a representation of the boar hunt. Accordingly, the original Greek statue has been attributed to Skopas of Paros, a well-known sculptor of the fourth century BCE and the architect of the temple.\r\n","relatedcount":0,"datebegin":100,"totaluniquepageviews":1672,"dimensions":"H. 123 x W. 63 x D. 42 cm (48 7/16 x 24 13/16 x 16 9/16 in.)\r\nweight: 235.4169 kg (519 lbs.)","exhibitioncount":3,"dateend":200,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

With its delicate vertical handle attached to the shoulder of the vessel by rivets, it also has funerary significance which is likely from the presence of the siren at the base of this handle. Such expensive metal vases were given as prizes in athletic contests and often later contained the cremated ashes of their owners. Such use probably explains the unusually fine state of preservation of this hydria. These vases were produced by hammering out the body in sheet bronze and attaching cast foot and handles by rivets or solder. Our hydria represents the highest quality of late Classical Greek metalwork.\r\n(David Gordon Mitten, 2004)","relatedcount":0,"datebegin":-430,"totaluniquepageviews":75,"dimensions":"41.9 cm h x 28.5 cm diam (37 cm diam with handles) (16 1/2 x 11 1/4 in.; 14 9/16 in. diam with handles)","exhibitioncount":3,"dateend":-400,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

Houston, 1974.64\r\n\r\nLegs bent in movement, arms swirling with a cascade of weapons, the great goddess Kali dances upon the prostrate body of the god Shiva. Her emaciated body points to her fierce nature and her association with ghosts and other dan¬gerous beings. Kali is the one of the most powerful forms of devi, the goddess, in the Hindu tradition. In the sixth-century text the Devi Mahatmya, Kali emerges from the forehead of the goddess Durga in order to fight two powerful demons. She is worshipped throughout India, and particularly in the eastern state of Bengal, where she is regarded as a great, divine mother. This stele sculpture was likely created for the external niche of a central Indian temple and may have come from the Chandella dynastic capital of Khajuraho.\r\n","style":null,"datebegin":900,"imagecount":2,"description":null,"totaluniquepageviews":159,"exhibitioncount":1,"dimensions":"67 x 52.7 x 18.5 cm (26 3/8 x 20 3/4 x 7 5/16 in.)\r\n245 lb.","dateoflastpageview":"2014-09-17","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-07-05","dateend":1099,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

Written in black, four words are evenly spaced around the bulbous body, with an almond-shaped lozenge marking the end of the phrase. The tall ascending letters curve gently to the left. The intersection of the neck and body is ringed by a black line, which breaks into a looping motif at the front of the jug, opposite the handle. The black slip is raised slightly above the white surface; a carving tool has been used to sharpen its contours. The jug has been reassembled from thirteen fragments; small losses filled with plaster have been painted white.

The interior also exhibits two vents connecting the tear duct areas of the eyes to the upper portion of the forehead. The vents, which measure 0.65 cm in diameter, would have been added as wax rods to the wax model to reduce the chances of air bubble flaws forming at the eyes. These features indicate that the bronze was produced using an indirect casting procedure. The incised lines in the hair and the finer features in the eyes appear to have been added directly to the wax model. The iris and pupil portions of the eyes are depicted in a shallow relief that would not have retained inlay material. \r\n \r\nMany areas of the neck exhibit coarse scrape and scratch marks that predate the formation of corrosion products and appear to be related to the original finishing of the bronze casting. Unlike the broader scrape marks associated with the finishing of the Running Boy at the Walters Art Gallery (1) and the Statue of a Youth at the Toledo Museum of Art (2), these scratches measure only about 0.15 cm or less. Traces of a gilt layer, some of which are embedded in the corrosion layers, are present at the back and proper left side of the neck. The band of light gray patina (2  3 cm wide) at the lower edge of the neck appears to be the remains of lead that was added at this location to secure the head to a torso. The bronze at this leaded surface exhibits a higher concentration of scratch marks related to surface preparation than is present at other areas of the neck. The patina covering the exterior surface is a varied green with areas of brown burial accretions. The distortion of the nose and most of the ragged break at the top and reverse sides predate the formation of corrosion products. \r\n \r\nChaplet holes are visible at the lower ears, the proper left and possibly the proper right sides of the neck, the lower front edge in the leaded area, and under the chin. All of these holes are fairly square and measure between 0.20 and 0.45 cm. The ear chaplets, which are positioned in a manner that may have assisted in holding earrings, and the chaplet at the proper left side of the neck were never patched. The proper left ear chaplet hole shows a substantial flanged periphery at the interior, which is indicative of piercing a soft wax or using a warm chaplet. The wall thickness of the casting at points in the region of the neck above the lead residue measures 0.17, 0.27, 0.15, 0.26, 0.28, 0.11, and 0.19 cm. Areas in the upper portion of the forehead measure 0.17, 0.08, and 0.07 cm. The thinness of the casting in this critical area emphasizes the need for the internal vents noted above to help prevent flaws.\r\n \r\nNOTES:\r\n1. Inv. no. 23.71; see C. C.

The Buddha extends his proper right hand downward, palm out, in the \"varadamudra\", or boon-giving gesture (sometimes also termed the gesture of munificence); he raises his left hand to shoulder height, where grasps the edge of his garment. The Buddha stands in a graceful S-curve, his right leg bearing the weight of his body, his left leg subtly flexed, the foot extended delicately forward. The features are low-set on the oval face: the forehead is high and broad; the eyes large, wide-set, and half closed; the nose and mouth small; the lips full and sensuous; and the chin dainty and rounded. Rising prominently from the crown of the head, the \"ushnisha\" is tall, relatively narrow, and rounded on its top. Small, snail-shell curls of hair cover the Buddha's head, the stylized curls cast as small bumps, or hemispherical beads, rather than as detailed rings of hair. Three registers of curls cover the \"ushnisha\", with a single curl (or possibly a jewel?) at the very top. Apart from the \"ushnisha\", the only other \"dvatrimsadvara-laksana\"--i.e., the thirty two supranormal signs that mark a \"superman\" (\"mahapurusa\") and that are the distinguishing iconographic characteristics of the Buddha--that appear on this image are the elongated earlobes, though it is possible that the fingers and toes are to be read as webbed, as they are so described in canonical texts. Three intaglio rings encircle the neck, creating the fleshy folds that frequently also are described in canonical texts. The Buddha wears an inner robe, or \"antarvasa\", which covers the lower body; wrapped around the waist, it hangs to the ankles, where it is visible between the Buddha's legs. He also wears a \"samghati\", or outer robe, which is draped, cape-like, over both shoulders; it flares out on either side of the Buddha's lower body as if animated by a breeze or by the Buddha's movements, and it terminates a little above the ankles, its lower edge appearing slightly above that of the \"antarvasa\". The two nearly diaphanous garments cling tightly to the Buddha's body, revealing its form and structure. The cape- or toga-like \"samghati\" gathers in several overlapping rings at the neck, suggesting a collar; the folds of the \"samghati\" fall elegantly over the body in a series of eight, elongated, descending parabolic arcs. The expanses of drapery that hang from the arms and flare outward on either side of the legs terminate in rippling folds that contrast with the austere areas of taut drapery that cover the body. Elliptical in form, the lotus base on which the Buddha stands is flat-topped; its indented, or waisted, sides divide the base into a shorter upper tier and a taller lower tier. Two rows of overlapping, rising lotus petals appear on the upper tier; three rows of overlapping, descending lotus petals appear on the lower tier, the outermost row not only wider than the others but cast with decorative embellishments. The lotus petal-décor extends around the entire base, which thus is fully decorated all round; by contrast, the back of the sculpture is plain and without representational details, except for the back of the head, which is rounded and covered with small, snail-shell curls of hair. Around its periphery, the sculpture's edges are lightly rounded at the shoulders and down the sides. Thick black pigment, possibly lacquer, appears in the hair and over the \"ushnisha\". The Buddha lacks a cast \"urna\"--the so-called third eye, which, according to canonical texts, actually is a tuft of hair, rather than a third eye--though one likely was painted there with cold pigments during at least part of the sculpture's history. Traces of mercury gilding appear on the face, body, drapery, and base. The sculpture originally was fully gilded, save the back. Except for the loss of gilding and except for small nicks and minor scratches here and there, the sculpture is generally in excellent condition. Numerous small, pinprick hollows depressions appear on the back; these are casting flaws, rather than later damage or other changes to the condition of the piece over the centuries; in fact, they are interesting because they indicate that the sculpture likely was cast horizontally, with the face and front of the body facing downward-rather than upside down, with the head at the bottom and the feet at the top-precisely so that such casting flaws would appear on the back rather than anyplace on the front of the image. Although the base is hollow, the Buddha is solid cast. The small hole that appears in the center of its back wall likely was punched into the lotus base at some time after the piece was cast, perhaps for use in securing the sculpture to an altar (or to a larger and perhaps more elaborate base.) In the picture published in Giuseppe Tucci's Tibetan Painted Scrolls (vol. 1, p. 206, fig. 85), this sculpture shows more cold gilding on the face than it now displays; the cold gilding probably was removed by a dealer or collector during the second half of the twentieth century in order to reveal the traces of original mercury gilding. In fact, the cold gilding on the face was not original to the piece, but likely was applied in successive applications over the centuries while the piece was under worship in Tibet.\r\n\r\nThe typed legend on an aged, yellowed, paper label affixed to the underside of the sculpture's base identifies the image as \"Shakyamuni\" and attributes the sculpture to Nepal; the label includes the number \"#68-12\", which indicates that it was the twelfth work of Asian art that Mr. and Mrs. John D. Rockefeller 3rd acquired in 1968. As I was the first curator of the Mr. and Mrs. John D. Rockefeller 3rd Collection at The Asia Society, New York (1980-1986), I am very familiar with such Rockefeller-Collection labels and thus can attest that this indeed is a Rockefeller- Collection label. The white, pressure-sensitive label with legend reading \"Property of ANN L. Gray\" in blue ink in a Germanic hand was handwritten with ball-point pen by William H. Wolff, who affixed it to the sculpture's base, over the Rockefeller-Collection label, in 1980, at the time he gave the sculpture to Ann L. Gray.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that this sculpture was in Tibet during most of its history. We cannot know when the sculpture was imported from Nepal into Tibet. However, there were close links between Nepal and the gTsan district of Tibet from early times, so that it possible that the sculpture ended up in Tibet shortly after it was cast. In any event, the sculpture must have been in Tibet for many centuries, remaining there until it left Tibet for India in the 1950s or 1960s.\r\n\r\nThe body of the Buddha displays a subtle elegance and plasticity that has an overt sensuous appeal. The outline is crisp and faultless, and a sense of movement is expressed by both the relaxed posture and the rippling edges of the garment. Classical features persist--the aquiline nose, the half-closed eyes, and the full lips--reflecting the distant influence of ancient Graeco-Roman sculpture through the Gandharan lineage. (Pal, Nepal: Where the Gods Are Young, pp. 60-71, no. 2) Based on Indian sculptures of the Gupta period (320-600), this image elegantly combines the stylistic traits of Buddha images from Mathura with those from Sarnath (both cities in Uttar Pradesh). These two cities were important artistic centers in Gupta India, and they have given us some of the finest Buddha images ever created in stone. Despite their prodigious lithic output, however, neither Mathura nor Sarnath produced any known Gupta-period bronze images of the Buddha. (Pal, Light of Asia, p. 201, no. 85.)\r\n\r\nThe treatment of this Buddha's garment, with its prominently indicated folds, follows the Mathura mode. However, in its essential characteristics--the garment's transparency, the slim elegance of the body, and the facial features--the figure is more typical of Sarnath than Mathura. (Pal, Light of Asia, p. 201, no. 85.)\r\n\r\nThe closest Indian model for this bronze sculpture likely is a brass image of Standing Buddha Sakyamuni in the collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art:\r\n\r\n Pratapaditya Pal et al., Light of Asia: Buddha Sakyamuni in Asian Art, exh. cat., Los Angeles County Museum of Art (Los Angeles: Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 1984), p. 101, cat. no. 85.\r\n\r\nThe two most closely related Nepalese sculptures are in the collection of the British Museum, London: a Standing Buddha Sakyamuni whose hands are in the same position as this image and which the British Museum curators date to the ninth-tenth century (1969.4-19.1), and a Seated Maitreya Buddha whose hands are in dharmacakra-mudra and which the British Museum curators date to the tenth century (1969.7-13.1). Both sculptures are pictured in\r\n\r\n Chandra L. Reedy, Himalayan Bronzes: Technology, Style, and Choices (Newark, Del.: University of Delaware Press, and London: Associated University Press, 1997), p. 225, fig. N233 (1969.4-19.1), and p. 227, fig. N238 (1969.7-13.1).\r\n\r\nThe Standing Buddha Sakyamuni (British Museum, 1969.4-19.1) is also published in \r\n\r\n Pratapaditya Pal, The Arts of Nepal, Part 1 (Sculpture), (Leiden and Köln: E.J. Brill, 1974), pl. 173 (dates the sculpture to the 9th-10th century).\r\n","totaluniquepageviews":290,"exhibitioncount":1,"dimensions":"H. 26.5 x W. 12 x D. 9.8 cm (10 7/16 x 4 3/4 x 3 7/8 in.) \r\n","dateoflastpageview":"2014-09-14","dateoffirstpageview":"2011-07-18","dateend":999,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

In these scenes, the boar is often depicted in a pose similar to this statuette. In a number of vase images of the later sixth and fifth centuries, the boars are shown with the interrupted or at least uneven ridge of bristles on the back, which is a natural feature enhanced by stylization. Compare the band cup Harvard Art Museums 1925.30.131.\r\n\r\nBecause of the animals strength and fierce defense, killing a wild boar proved the hunters prowess, and a brave warrior could be likened to a boar, just as images of boar hunting could serve as the visual equivalents of scenes of warfare. In ancient Macedonia, young men did not acquire full adult status until after their first successful boar hunt. Representations of boars and their heads or foreparts were employed as shield devices and other decoration on armor. The heroic connotations and heraldic qualities of the beast made it suitable as an image on coins, for example on Harvard Art Museums 1972.173, a silver didrachm from Methymna on Lesbos. A number of Greek bronzes represent boars, although free-standing statuettes are quite rare. A late Archaic or early Classical example at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (10.162), once was attached to the shoulder of a large vessel. This statuette is more likely to have been freestanding, perhaps as part of a hunting group dedicated at a sanctuary.\r\n","relatedcount":0,"datebegin":-530,"totaluniquepageviews":56,"dimensions":"8.7 x 14.1 x 3.5 cm (3 7/16 x 5 9/16 x 1 3/8 in.)","exhibitioncount":1,"dateend":-520,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

Unlike most of her contemporaries who made lithographs, Cassatt experimented with aquatint and softground etching techniques to make tonal prints. In these experiments, she worked closely with Degas and Pissarro. Their methods were new and untried, so only a few impressions were printed from each plate. Yet, these early prints are especially significant to her lifelong printmaking enterprise for they established her interest in and commitment to tonal etching. A pioneering 1890 exhibition of Japanese color woodblock prints at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts inspired Cassatt and her cohorts to begin printing in color, thus expanding the tonal possibilities of their prints. Cassatt's first efforts were a series of ten color etching and aquatints that appeared in her first solo exhibition at the gallery Durand-Ruel in Paris. In this series, Cassatt wanted to replicate the practice and appearance of Japanese woodblock prints produced from multiple blocks but she wanted to use copperplates instead. \"The Bath,\" sometimes called \"The Tub,\" is the first print from that series and simply depicts a woman and a naked baby beside a bathtub. \r\nIn order to print in color Cassatt needed to use more than one plate, and the final seventeenth state of \"The Tub\" is printed from two plates. In this final state, one plate carried the dry point lines and softground decoration, while the second plate carried the tonal areas that printed the colored inks. Along with the very fine impression of the final state, this group of prints includes seven proof states in which Cassatt was working out the necessary process for combining the lines and colored areas within the composition. Of particular note from this group is the forth state which was printed from only one plate. The subsequent proofs, which have overlapping lines and colors, are all printed from two plates. The proofs well demonstrate the experimental nature of Cassatt's printmaking practice--she prints on different color papers and variously leaves ink on the plate to create varying atmospheric areas of tone. The set reveals the ingenuity and diligence necessary to create the final version of the image.\r\nThese particular impressions of \"The Tub\" are historically significant as well. Cassatt kept them among her own \"studio collection\" which included hundreds of experimental proofs and unpublished prints. When she died in 1926, the collection went to her Parisian dealer Ambroise Vollard, who supplemented it by buying back Cassatt prints from her earliest collectors, including Degas. Upon Vollard's death in 1939, the prints were sold to another distinguished Parisian dealer, Henri Petiet, whose heirs began selling off parts of his collection after his death in 1980. The Cassatt prints were first offered through the New York print dealer Marc Rosen in 2000. This set was purchased then but was recently returned to the dealer, thus becoming available to Harvard Art Museum.","relatedcount":0,"datebegin":1890,"totaluniquepageviews":356,"dimensions":"plate: 31.9 x 24.9 cm (12 9/16 x 9 13/16 in.)\r\nsheet: 43.5 x 30.4 cm (17 1/8 x 11 15/16 in.)","exhibitioncount":0,"dateend":1891,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Fogg Museum, Gift of Dr. Ernest G.

The artist has whimsically concocted a creature with a trilobed crest, a cere (protrusion above the bill), rings of multicolored feathers around the neck and breast, and a yellow wing. The birds salient feature, however, is a fan-shaped tail, which above all else suggests that it is a peacock. There is a single, legible inscription in Syriac meaning eye or fount between the birds back and tail. On the upper walls beneath the rim, a band of scrolling triangular leaves is bordered by black lines.\r\nNo slip is detectable over the light buff ceramic body of the bowl. Except for its flat, slightly concave base, which is only partially glazed, it appears to have been covered in a clear glaze. Its condition is difficult to assess, because much of the interior surface is coated with a modern varnish. It is clearly fragmentary, reassembled from numerous small pieces, and has considerable overpainting along the rim, the scrolling band, and the lower body of the peacock.","totaluniquepageviews":445,"exhibitioncount":2,"dimensions":"6.7 x 16.2 cm (2 5/8 x 6 3/8 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-09-11","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-11-20","dateend":10,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

The rounded walls and slightly everted rim of this dish recall those of Tang white wares. Whether the production of color-splashed ceramics in the Islamic world was an independent development or was also inspired by wares imported from China is still unresolved. A copper oxide was applied in patches on the exterior and interior rim of this dish before it was fired upright. The green patches flowed freely in the clear glaze, pooling at the center into a shape serendipitously resembling a lotus blossom. Ceramics with colorants running in a clear glaze were broadly popular and widely produced in the early Islamic era; wasters have been found from Afrasiyab, in Uzbekistan, to Fustat, in Egypt.Because this visual effect could be achieved through various techniques, assigning place and time of production to these wares is often difficult.On the basis of its well-formed foot, its finely potted profile with recurved rim, and its lack of secondary incised decoration, it is attributed to Iraq.","totaluniquepageviews":71,"exhibitioncount":2,"dimensions":"4.1 x 21.2 cm (1 5/8 x 8 3/8 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-08-06","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-12-27","dateend":0,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

Broad ring foot with mid-length stem. Body flares from stem, rounds up, and turns in sharply to form a relatively narrow, flat shoulder. Neck curves up from shoulder and continues almost vertically to the slightly flaring rim. Narrow lip. \r\n\r\nTwo sets of handles. One set is upswung, beginning at shoulder, continuing above rim, and then curving downward abruptly to attach to rim. These handles are composed of two straps connected at points along the interior with struts. They are decorated along their exterior faces with a delicate black-figure ivy scroll with berries. Two sets of discs, decorated with black-figure sunbursts, are attached to each handle, one approximately half way up from shoulder, one at the topmost point. The topmost discs are likely modern additions. The other two handles are rolled, and are affixed to the body of the nestoris just below the shoulder. These curve upwards, and are decorated with an elongated tongue pattern at the point of attachment. \r\n\r\nThe vessel is elaborately decorated with four scenes covering the body and neck of the vessel: Orestes at Delphi; Phrixos leading the ram to sacrifice; a battle between Greeks and Easterners; the death of Aktaion.\r\n\r\nSeparated from its stem by a series of rays and surmounted by a line of meanders with a periodically intervening cross that serves as a groundline, the vessel's obverse shows Orestes at Delphi. In the center of the scene, Orestes, who is naked except for boots and a cape that billows behind him to the left, kneels on a rock, presumably the omphalos. He holds a long dagger up in his right hand, the sheath of the dagger in his left, and he faces left to look at the winged fury who stands behind him with each of her arms bent upwards. Below the fury sits a draped woman with her hand at her chest. Apollo, draped from the waist, stands to the right of Orestes with his right hand up and holding laurel branches in his left arm. The wings of the fury, two bucrania above the scene, the laurel branches, and some other details are in added white. Bordering either side of the scene are florid palmettes.\r\n\r\nA broad lotus and palmette register separates this scene from that on the neck showing Phrixos' sacrifice of the ram with the golden fleece. Phrixos, wearing only shoes and a cape at his neck, leads the ram by its horns to an altar of Zeus, which is place at the far left of the scene. The altar is surmounted by an ionic column. Aietes stands between Phrixos and the altar, holds a stick, and faces front. Behind Phrixos stands a veiled, front-facing Chalkiope with her right arm bent up. Behind her is a male in eastern garb who mimics her stance, except that his head faces left and he holds a long staff in his left hand. Bordering the scene on either side are double rows of dots. Above the scene is a thick laurel band, and then above this is a narrow egg and dart register at the rim of the vessel.\r\n\r\nDecorative registers and borders on the reverse are identical to those on the obverse.\r\n\r\nOn the body of the vessel's reverse two bearded Greeks at the left of the scene battle two eastern warriors on the right. The figures are shown in two rows in what appears to be an attempt at representing recession in space. Those in the upper row are presumably meant to be behind those below. The Greeks charge forward with spears in their right hands and shields in their left. Each holds his shield so that the viewer can see its interior. Both are naked except for the chlamys attached around the neck that billows behind. The helmet of the Greek warrior above has slipped backwards. The crested helmet of the Greek warrior below sits firmly on his head. The eastern warrior in the upper row is naked except for his billowing chlamys and an elaborate, slouching headdress. The spear he holds in his right hand is pointing down. In his left hand he holds a bow. The warrior below wears a crested helmet, tunic and trousers decorated with rows of wavy lines. He holds a shield and spear in his right hand. In his left, he holds up an axe.\r\n\r\nOn the neck of the reverse, antlers sprout from Aktaion's head as he is attacked by four of his dogs. He faces forward and is naked except for his shoes and chlamys. His right arm is bent behind his head and he holds a thick dagger in his right hand. Artemis stands to the left watching. Another woman sits at the right and watches. Vegetal filler indicates that the scene takes place outdoors. \r\n\r\n[Andreya Mihaloew, 6/13/2008]\r\n","dateoflastpageview":"2014-09-16","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-05-14","primaryimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:DDC107957_dynmc","dated":"340-320 BCE","contextualtextcount":0,"copyright":null,"period":"Classical period, Late, to Early Hellenistic","url":"http://harvardartmuseums.org/art/288856","provenance":"This vase was re-discovered in 1869 in the collection of the Duke Marie-Pierre-Hubert of Cambaceres, France, where it was noted in the inventory lists as a purchase of June 22, 1842.

It is often called Arezzo ware for the modern name of the town. This type of pottery was coated in red slip and originated in the first century BCE. It became extremely popular in the first century CE, but eventually was surpassed by Samian ware, which was created mainly in Gaul. \r\n\r\nArretine vessels were most often made from molds, an example of which can be seen in this collection. Molds could be used for numerous castings until they eventually wore down or broke. Often the decoration on Arretine vessels was meant to imitate the more expensive silver vessels of the day. Instead of being mold-made, some Arretine ware was created on a wheel and decorated by hand. \r\n\r\nArretine ware is often confused with terra sigillata, which translates to \"stamped earth.\" Though the definitions are very similar and often interchangeable, terra sigillata generally refers to highly decorated red gloss pottery, as opposed to red slip. The red gloss was obtained by polishing the slip until it reached silky luster, then fired at a low temperature. \r\n\r\n[Jessica Pesce 8/2010]","style":null,"datebegin":-15,"imagecount":4,"description":"Footed Arretine ware bowl with a diameter of about 18 centimeters.

The reliefs identified the entombed individuals. This slab with the bust of Ba'altega, daughter of Hayran, is a typical example. It draws attention to her family relations by naming her father and representing her two sons, Hayran and Simon. A similar emphasis on family may be found on the Greek Stele of Melisto (1961.86), to the left. Conspicuous display of adornment advertises the family's wealth. The woman touching her veil is a gesture derived from Greek tradition, \r\nwhereas Ba'altega's clothing-a headdress comprising bandeau, turban, and veil-and the frontality and stylized features of the composition set this monument firmly in a local, Palmyrene context.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther commentary:\r\n\r\nA head of a lady carved in the same style but with hair arranged somewhat differently has been placed by Harald Ingholt in Group II of the Palmyrene funerary monuments and dated about 150-200 CE (Comstock, Vermeule, 1976, p. 258, no. 404).\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that the object in the left hand of the Harvard relief might be a distaff or similar tool for spinning, but 'Ala the daughter of Iarhai in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen, holds a similar thing almost horizontallly, and it looks like a folded whip with a pincone top. See Colledge, 1976, fig. 64. Since other Palmyrene men and women hold a variety of complex, symbolic objects in the left hand (although one man, in Paris, is clearly a scribe with stylus and tablets), it seems likely that this folded-over length of tassel on the end of a stick is a ticket of passage to a religious cult or the world beyond the tomb rather than a mere object of domestic industry. The pomegranates held in Palmyrene peoples' hands fall into the same category.","style":null,"datebegin":150,"imagecount":2,"description":"The relief depicts a woman in elaborate costume flanked by two children above, left and right. The monument has been dated by Harald Ingholt. The woman in the center is touching the edge of her veil with the usual gesture of her raised right hand; she holds a ceremonial object, like a cord with pomegranate tassels, against her upper stomach with the left hand. She wears jewelry where it is possible for display, from gold bands in the hair to triple-pendant earrings, to four different types of necklaces, to bracelets on both wrists, and, finally, to rings on her fingers.\r\n\r\nThe children behind her seem to be a young girl with a necklace or apron of fruits, on her right, and a slightly older boy on her left, a ceremonial tassel in his left hand.\r\n\r\nThere are three inscriptions on the relief. The one belonging to the woman is located to the right of the veil and extends to the left side of the head of the child on the right. It reads \"daughter of Hayran, Alas!\" The inscription to the right of the child on the right, belongs to that child and reads \"Hayran, her son.\" The inscription on the left, belonging to the child on the left, reads \"Simon, her son.\"\r\n\r\nCatalogue entry from the publication: Stone Sculptures: The Greek, Roman, and Etruscan Collections of the Harvard University Art Museums; Cornelius C.

The artist paid close attention to details, depicting individual hairs, shading the petals of flowers, and painting the piercing eyes of both carnivores and their victims. The scenes of animal combat on this shield are set in a lush landscape, divided by trees and dense vegetation. Small animals and birds inhabit the entire surface, including the borders.\r\n\r\nLions are familiar symbols of royalty in India. Many royal houses bear the family name \"Singh\" (lion), and historical inscriptions often liken the power of a Hindu king to that of a lion, the animal lord of the wilderness. Thus, this luxurious shield not only highlights the talents of its artist but also symbolizes the strength of its royal patron.

Chinese wares reached Ottoman lands from the early fifteenth-century onwards through trade, gift exchange, and booty. Here, while the common design of three bunches of grapes and vine leaves and the foliated rim of the dish remain true to Chinese models, the loose and spontaneous arrangement of the motifs clearly differentiates it from its prototypes. The intermixing of the early fifteenth-century Ming-dynasty (1368-1644) grape motif and the Yuan-dynasty (1279-1368) wave-and-rock border pattern, as well as the addition of turquoise to the traditional blue-and-white color palette, also attest to the artistic license used by Iznik artisans. Still, Iznik blue-and-white ceramic wares could not aspire to the quality of their porcelain counterparts.

The inscription under the portrait states that one of them is [of] Spain and the other France. The inscription below the portrait of Francis contains the artists name and fictitiously proclaims that they [Francis and Charles] visited Sultan Selim II (r. 1566-74) to collect an imperial decree. While the two monarchs, archrivals of the Ottoman sultans, never set foot in the Ottoman capital, images of their likenesses did, providing the artist with prototypes. Here, Nigari has taken as his model an unknown portrait of Charles V possibly a print modeled after Charles portrait by Lucas Cranach. Charles, shown in profile view is depicted in European headdress and costume. The artist executed the portrait using minimal depth. The artist Haydar Nigari was a sea captain and was in charge of the Ottoman Imperial Naval yards. He was also a poet and close companion of Selim II during his princedom and rule. Both portraits were most likely later included in an album made for Ahmed I (r. 1603-17) partially known as the Bellini album.","dateoflastpageview":"2014-08-23","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-06-17","primaryimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:DDC106450_dynmc","dated":"1566-1574","contextualtextcount":2,"copyright":null,"period":"Ottoman period","url":"http://harvardartmuseums.org/art/215796","provenance":"Possibly Imperial Library, Istanbul.

The inscription is written in two columns around the shaft of the nail; the first column is the one adjacent to the head of the nail. The nail was broken into two pieces just below the inscription and has been repaired. \r\n\r\nThe inscription commemorates the building of the Emush (\"Temple: Foundation [of the land]\") for the goddess Inanna (\"Lady of Heaven\") and the god Lugalemush (\"Lord of the Emush-temple\"). The latter is probably another title of the god Dumuzi, whose temple, the Emush, was in Bad-Tibira (modern: Tell al-Mada'in). The final seven lines also record a pact between Enmetena and Lugal-kine-dudu, and may be among the first written evidence for this kind of political accord.\r\n\r\nThe text reads:\r\nFor Inanna and Lugalemush, Enmetena, ruler of Lagash, built the Emush, their beloved temple, and ordered (these) clay nails for them. Enmetena, who built the Emush--his personal god is Shulutul.\r\nAt the time Enmetena, ruler of Lagash, and Lugalkiginehdudu, ruler of Uruk, established brotherhood (between themselves).\r\n\r\nSumerian text: \r\n(Col.

Their shape tend to be assimilated to that of a bird by the addition a crop at the neck and often also eyes. Buff examples with reddish-brown painted decoration comprising geometric motifs as well as animal figures are known from \"Cemetery B\" at Tepe Sialk, near Kashan on the Iranian plateau.","style":null,"datebegin":-900,"imagecount":1,"description":"The vessel has a shallow foot with flat base. A slight edge marks the transition of shoulder to neck, which opens in a flaring mouth. A flat strap handle connects lip and shoulder. Opposite the handle is a spout terminating in a long, trough-shaped and tapering beak (the very tip appears to be missing). It is linked to the vessels lip by a small bridge of clay. The bird-like appearance of the vessel is reinforced by a crop on the neck of the spout, below the beak. Two raised points towards the rear of the vessel, one on each side of the handle, were perhaps inspired by bird anatomy or by the bosses covering rivets on metal vessels of similar shape.\r\n\r\nThe body of the vessel is fired buff to light reddish brown. Its surface is polished and painted with dark reddish-brown decoration. The most elaborate patterns occur at the transition to the spout, where a row of elongated triangles is reminiscent of a birds breast feathers. Other motifs include checkerboard and crosshatching. A large diamond filled with checkerboard decorates each side of the vessel, elongated triangles run along the beak-shaped spout, and wavy bands encircle the vessels mouth. The handle bears zigzag decoration with interspersed dots, the handle base is framed by volutes, and there is a diamond filled with dotted crosshatching below. On the vessel's interior, the lip is lined with dots, which also appear on the exterior at the transition from shoulder to neck and above the foot. The unpolished underside of the foot shows a sloppily painted cross with a dot in each quadrant, as well as smudged paint.\r\n\r\nThe vessels mouth and spout are reassembled from a number of fragments; some 40% of the lip are restored. The painted decoration is abraded where the vessels circumference is the largest. \r\n","totaluniquepageviews":27,"exhibitioncount":0,"dimensions":"18.5 x 33 x 18 cm (7 5/16 x 13 x 7 1/16 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-09-08","dateoffirstpageview":"2010-11-25","dateend":-700,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

Their vibrant encaustic (wax-based) painting was well preserved by the dry Egyptian climate. Such mummy portraits, often called Fayum Portraits after the region where many were found, reflect the fusion of Egyptian funerary practices, Greek painting techniques, and Roman portrait traditions. Leaving an anchor for the soul on earth by placing a substitute representation of the deceased within the tomb was a long-standing practice in Egypt. The image did not necessarily bear a physical resemblance but showed the deceased as virtuous. The man's hair and beard are trimmed short, as on the marble head of a bearded man (1949.47.138) in the center of the gallery.

From the Gupta period (thirdearly sixth century) onward, the jambs on either side of the door have often been decorated with groups of figures set into stacks of architecturally ornamented registers. These groups frequently depict divine couples, known as mithuna, which are represented in the smaller panel to the right. The figures on the left panel appear to include combinations of mithuna, apsaras (celestial females), and a donative scene of two women making offerings to a male ascetic figure, possibly a form of the god Shiva or one of his devotees. These divine beings are considered auspicious, and their presence on doorways is said to secure blessings and protection for the sacred space inside.","style":null,"datebegin":800,"imagecount":2,"description":null,"totaluniquepageviews":29,"exhibitioncount":1,"dimensions":"H. 80 x W. 30.8 x D. 11.2 cm (31 1/2 x 12 1/8 x 4 7/16 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-08-08","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-07-30","dateend":999,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

The decoration of this small bowl has been executed with exceptional detail and care. Fluid and confident strokes of black slip delineate a crested bird, a spotted feline, and a well-groomed horse. These forms are filled or dotted with green and yellow. The feline and the horse raise their right forelegs; they both sport ankle bands and scalloped collars. The horse has a cropped mane, a knotted tail, and curling fetlocks. Filling its body is a bold pseudo-inscription in floriated and spiraling Kufic script. The top of its eye is defined by two extended parallel lines; this distinctive treatment is occasionally found in figural wares excavated in Nishapur. The feline may be identified as a cheetah by the black stripe descending from its eye.\r\nThe vignette of a collared feline on the back of an imposing horse may be a shorthand reference to the costly, prestigious, and ancient sport of hunting with cheetahs. Capable of short bursts of extraordinary speed, cheetahs were usually set on gazelles, rabbits, and other fleet game, but because stamina was not one of their virtues, they had to be conveyed to the hunt. One of the cheetah trainers more demanding tasks was to teach his charge to ride pillion on the back of a horse moving at any speed.\r\nThe exterior decoration of this bowl consists of pendant leaf shapes painted in an alternating pattern: a buff leaf with an interior dot-dash-dot device alternates with a colored leaf, sequentially yellow or green. No slip is detectable over the light buff ceramic body. The entire bowl, including the flat, slightly concave base, is covered in a clear glaze. The bowl has been reassembled from at least three large fragments and has minor losses and repairs along the rim.","totaluniquepageviews":149,"exhibitioncount":2,"dimensions":"7.4 x 18.6 cm (2 15/16 x 7 5/16 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-09-05","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-11-20","dateend":0,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

Perhaps a bulls head is represented, but the blurring of the black pigment in the glaze has obscured the artists intentions here and elsewhere. The rendering of the hands is equally ambiguous, possibly meant to suggest the thumb and knuckles of a clenched fist. The hand reaching backward appears to hold a leafy branch. The space around the figure is filled with a miscellany of motifs, including a flower, a palmette, fragmentary letters in Kufic script, and a bird. Groups of four or five short lines divide the rim into five sections, colored either green or yellow.\r\nThis bowl closely resembles figural wares with buff-colored bodies reported by Charles Wilkinson to have come from excavations at Nishapur. Here, however, the off-white background is obtained from slip covering a reddish ceramic fabric, and the yellow background results from staining from fine chromite particles, rather than the more customary lead-tin or lead-antimony. The base, which is slightly concave and beveled, is only partially covered by the slip. The bowl, once broken, is in good condition, having been put back together from at least four major fragments. On the interior, overpainting is largely limited to the center: the figures collar and shoulders, his groin, and the upper lapels of his torso.","totaluniquepageviews":108,"exhibitioncount":2,"dimensions":"8 x 26.8 cm (3 1/8 x 10 9/16 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-09-07","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-11-20","dateend":0,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

Sackler Museum, Gift of Nanette Rodney Kelekian in memory of George and Ilse Hanfmann, 1993.222.AB\r\n\r\nThis sunk relief probably formed a door lintel of the mastaba, or funerary chapel, of Ptahshepses, also called Impy, in the great necropolis of Saqqara in Lower Egypt. The mastabas owner, a palace superintendent, is represented on either side of an offering formula written in hieroglyphs. In each instance he wears a short kilt and holds a staff and a scepter, but his headdresses differ. As is typical for Egyptian reliefs and paintings, the chest of the human figure is shown frontally, and the head and legs in profile. Hieroglyphs identify Ptahshepses three daughters whom he loves on the left side, and his wife and his son, Impy II, on the right. Inside the mastaba, other reliefs depicted food offerings, serving the needs of the deceased in perpetuity.\r\n\r\nAdditional commentary:\r\n\r\nThis relief was probably a door lintel in Ptahshepses funerary chapel, called a mastaba, at the great necropolis of Saqqara in Lower Egypt. During the Old Kingdom, wealthy private officials began constructing funerary mastabas near the burial pyramids of the king and his family. The names and titles of the palace superintendent Ptahshepses carved on the lintel connect this work to a Dynasty VI (c. 24002250? BCE) mastaba that was excavated by the Egyptian Department of Antiquities in 1929 and 1930.(1) The mastaba is located just to the north of the entrance to the pyramid of King Unas, the last ruler of Dynasty V (c. 25242400 BCE). Inside the mastaba, other reliefs depicted people bringing offerings for the deceased as well as representations of Ptahshepses and his son Impy II. The walls were decorated with reliefs showing a wide array of religious and everyday scenes. The unifying theme of these representations was the abundance and perpetuity of food offerings for the deceased. The burial pit inside the mastaba had been plundered, but several alabaster jar lids were found, three of which bore the name of Pepi II, the last ruler of Dynasty VI.The style and technique of the relief also place the lintel in the last part of Dynasty VI, just before the collapse of the Egyptian Old Kingdom during the First Intermediate Period (c. 22502061 BCE). At the end of the Old Kingdom, the style emphasized more angular shapes while the human body became more elongated, with the head proportionately smaller and the arms thinner. The lintel is carved in sunken relief whereby any modeling of the figures is carved within the contour lines below the level of the background surface, which is left as is. This technique allows for a more speedy and cost-efficient production and characterizes the works from this period. It is possible that two different hands carved the right and left sides of the lintel, as a comparison of the two figures representing Ptahshepses illustrates. On the left, his body is stockier, with a fuller face and a rounded belly, while the figure on the right is taller and more angular. In Egypt, where artistic individuality was not emphasized, it was common for more than one artist to work on a single relief; though the two edges of the lintel do not join at the break, it is certain that these two sides comprise a unified whole. A similar limestone lintel of the same official was in the Breitbart Collection auctioned at Sothebys in 1990.(2)\r\n\r\nMarian Feldman\r\n\r\n1.

The result is a level of watery saturation in which it feels as if the fibers of the paper are practically drowning and swollen with pigment. The geometric design mimics mosaic work or tesserae, and this decorative rather than representational approach to the picture plane is redolent of a kind of Kabala-like decorative strategies. This drawing is notable for its verdant palette, which in its sprightliness summons all of the energies of spring. The silver disks that hover in the image, however, bring a mineral, earthly, and even \"timeless\" quality to the otherwise fleeting sensibility of the spring-like green. The drawing teeters and totters between these naturalistic references and sensibilities and a clear and strong interest in geometrical forms and the kind of all-over composition pioneered by an artist like Mondrian.

Unlike most of her contemporaries who made lithographs, Cassatt experimented with aquatint and softground etching techniques to make tonal prints. In these experiments, she worked closely with Degas and Pissarro. Their methods were new and untried, so only a few impressions were printed from each plate. Yet, these early prints are especially significant to her lifelong printmaking enterprise for they established her interest in and commitment to tonal etching. A pioneering 1890 exhibition of Japanese color woodblock prints at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts inspired Cassatt and her cohorts to begin printing in color, thus expanding the tonal possibilities of their prints. Cassatt's first efforts were a series of ten color etching and aquatints that appeared in her first solo exhibition at the gallery Durand-Ruel in Paris. In this series, Cassatt wanted to replicate the practice and appearance of Japanese woodblock prints produced from multiple blocks but she wanted to use copperplates instead. \"The Bath,\" sometimes called \"The Tub,\" is the first print from that series and simply depicts a woman and a naked baby beside a bathtub. \r\nIn order to print in color Cassatt needed to use more than one plate, and the final seventeenth state of \"The Tub\" is printed from two plates. In this final state, one plate carried the dry point lines and softground decoration, while the second plate carried the tonal areas that printed the colored inks. Along with the very fine impression of the final state, this group of prints includes seven proof states in which Cassatt was working out the necessary process for combining the lines and colored areas within the composition. Of particular note from this group is the forth state which was printed from only one plate. The subsequent proofs, which have overlapping lines and colors, are all printed from two plates. The proofs well demonstrate the experimental nature of Cassatt's printmaking practice--she prints on different color papers and variously leaves ink on the plate to create varying atmospheric areas of tone. The set reveals the ingenuity and diligence necessary to create the final version of the image.\r\nThese particular impressions of \"The Tub\" are historically significant as well. Cassatt kept them among her own \"studio collection\" which included hundreds of experimental proofs and unpublished prints. When she died in 1926, the collection went to her Parisian dealer Ambroise Vollard, who supplemented it by buying back Cassatt prints from her earliest collectors, including Degas. Upon Vollard's death in 1939, the prints were sold to another distinguished Parisian dealer, Henri Petiet, whose heirs began selling off parts of his collection after his death in 1980. The Cassatt prints were first offered through the New York print dealer Marc Rosen in 2000. This set was purchased then but was recently returned to the dealer, thus becoming available to Harvard Art Museum.","relatedcount":0,"datebegin":1890,"totaluniquepageviews":12,"dimensions":"plate: 31.9 x 24.6 cm (12 9/16 x 9 11/16 in.)\r\nsheet: 47 x 30.6 cm (18 1/2 x 12 1/16 in.)","exhibitioncount":0,"dateend":1891,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Fogg Museum, Gift of Dr. Ernest G.

Sackler Museum, The Norma Jean Calderwood Collection of Islamic Art, 2002.50.72\r\n\r\nOne of the most significant innovations attributed to ninth-century potters working in Basra was the application of luster painting to ceramics. In this failure-prone technique, the artist painted a mixture of metal oxides onto an already fired and glazed surface. The vessel was then fired a second time in a kiln with a low-oxygen atmosphere. If all went right, the design was deposited on the glaze as an irides¬cent stain, imperceptible to the touch. Probably the costliest product of the Basra kilns, lusterware was widely exported and imitated. Knowledge of the luster technique gradually spread both eastward into Iran and westward as far as Spain.\r\n","style":null,"datebegin":9,"imagecount":2,"description":"Repaired from about twenty fragments, but with only small losses, this bowl is decorated with two startled-looking animals a rooster, and, in its beak, a fish. Their wide-eyed energy is sustained by other sharply angled elements of the design: fins and tail feathers, coxcomb, and fluttering scarf. These creatures have long carried positive associations: the rooster, as the harbinger of dawn, symbolizes hope, while the fish suggests bounty. In religious contexts, the rooster also developed more specifically auspicious connotations: according to a popular epigram attributed to the Prophet Muhammad, he crows when he sees an angel; in Christian tradition, his invigorating sound recalls the faltering to their faith. The glazed base of this bowl bears an undecipherable inscription in Kufic script.","totaluniquepageviews":240,"exhibitioncount":4,"dimensions":"5.9 x 23.2 cm (2 5/16 x 9 1/8 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-09-04","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-06-18","dateend":9,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

The vase is in very good condition, unbroken with only minor cracks on the interior surface, and minor chipping, particularly around the lip. \r\n\r\nOn the obverse is a simple stage (Type I, Trendall, Phlyax) without supporting columns. A phlyax stands on the left with a Doric column behind him. He wears padded tights and jacket and a black bordered cloak. Concealed within the folds of the cloak are yellow and white objects. He wears a headband and his hair and beard are white (Type L, Phlyax). In his right hand he holds a crooked staff.\r\n\r\nTo the far right is a double door through which has just come an old woman, who advances towards the phlyax with outstretched arms. She wears a long-sleeved peplos with a thick black border. She has short white hair and a straight nose, and her mouth is open (Type R, Phlyax). Hanging above and between the two figures is a comic mask with a good head of hair, short beard, and open mouth (Type B, Phlyax).\r\n\r\nOn the reverse, two youths stand facing each other. The one to the left holds a staff in his right hand; his right shoulder is bare. The youth to the right has both arms concealed in his himation. Between them hang a pair of weights, symbol of the palaestra.\r\n\r\nThis is the name-piece of the McDaniel Painter. Particularly characteristic of this artist are the thin laurel leaves around the rim and the relatively small meander.\r\n\r\n\r\n","dateoflastpageview":"2014-09-15","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-06-09","primaryimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:DDC104314_dynmc","dated":"400-370 BCE","contextualtextcount":0,"copyright":null,"period":"Classical period, Late","url":"http://harvardartmuseums.org/art/167822","provenance":"Dr. Jacob Hirsch, Geneva, (by 1955).

Sackler Museum, Transfer from the Alice Corinne McDaniel Collection, Department of the Classics, Harvard University, 2007.104.4\r\n\r\nFrom the later fifth century BC onward, Greeks in South Italy produced their own red-figure pottery. This krater, for mixing wine with water, depicts two phlyakes, comic actors with masks and padded costumes. Such scenes provide important information about ancient theater production. The otherwise anonymous McDaniel Painter is named after this vase.\r\n\r\nFurther commentary:\r\n\r\nIn the fourth century, South Italian red-figure ware provided stiff competition for the Attic pottery industry, eventually replacing it as the import of choice in many markets. The so-called phlyax vessels, produced in greatest numbers in the workshops of Apulia and Paestum, are widely thought to show scenes either from a form of South Italian comedic drama parodying the heroes and themes of Attic tragedy, or from the re-performance of Attic comedy in South Italy (see Cambitoglu and Trendall 1978. See also S. Douglas Olson, Broken Laughter, Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 14ff). The actors, known as phlyakes, are depicted in masks and padded suits, and often sport exaggerated phalluses. Their appearance on these vases, along with components of stage buildings and sets, gives some insight into ancient Greek theater production. The McDaniel Painter, an otherwise anonymous Apulian vase painter, derives his name from this krater's attribution to him. His work is characterized by the thin laurel leaves below the rim of the vessel and the small meander pattern at the ground line of the scene.\r\n--Andreya Mihaloew, 2008","relatedcount":0,"datebegin":-400,"totaluniquepageviews":396,"dimensions":"30 cm h x 33.5 cm diam (11 13/16 x 13 3/16 in.)","exhibitioncount":1,"dateend":-370,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

Sackler Museum, Gift of Martha Gefter and Thomas Lemberg in honor of David Gordon Mitten, 2001.269\r\n\r\nThis mosaic fragment, probably from a church, exhibits a skillful use of painterly techniques in rendering a peacock under a tree. The peacock was earlier associated with Eastern, paradisiacal gardens and functioned as a pagan symbol of springtime, renewal, and apotheosis. Appearing in every artistic medium of the Byzantine period, however, it additionally assumed connotations of the eternal triumph of Christ in a splendid, Edenlike heaven. Mosaics were placed on floors rather than walls and were a vital element in the decorative schemes of the public buildings and wealthiest houses of late antiquity.\r\n","style":null,"datebegin":400,"imagecount":1,"description":"The peacock is depicted mainly in profile with its head turned as it looks out over its back.

Monuments with representations of children are a poignant testimony to a relatively high rate of infant mortality. The inscription on this stele tells us that it commemorates Melisto, daughter of Ktesikrates, from the district of Potamos in Attica. The smiling girl with chubby cheeks stands quietly within an architectural frame. A Maltese dog jumps up playfully toward her right hand, which holds another pet, a bird. Her left hand clasps a doll with truncated limbs-a favorite toy, or perhaps a votive offering. A metal wreath or diadem was originally inserted into the holes on either side of the head. Traces of painted decoration survive on the cornice.\r\n\r\nAdditional commentary:\r\n\r\nFrom: Stone Sculptures: The Greek, Roman, and Etruscan Collections of the Harvard University Art Museums; Cornelius C. Vermuele and Amy Brauer, HUAM, Cambridge, 1990. \r\n\r\nAn inscription written on a narrow architrave below the pediment reads: MELISTO KTHSIKPATOUS POTAMIOU (Melisto, daughter of Ktesikrates, from the Demos of Potamos).\r\n\r\nThe stele is good-to-average Pentelic marble (probably not: identified as marble from Sounion by istope analysis - article in file). The basic condition is also good, but \"all the surfaces have been more or less recut\" (J. Frel, letter of 15 June, 1973). There are faint traces of painted egg and dart motif above the inscription.\r\n\r\nMelisto, daughter of Ktesikrates, holds a doll in her left hand and a bird in the right, and looks down toward the furry little dog springing up at her from the right. She wears a simple girt chiton, like a nightgown.\r\n\r\nThe deme of Potamos, whence Melisto came, was on the Attic coast, north of Sounion, south of Brauron, where statues of girls similar to this representation in relief were found in the sanctuary of Artemis. The head of a statue in this style and tradition is represented by 1922.72.

Reading from top to bottom and right to left, this hanging scroll displays a section of the twenty-third chapter of the sutra, which was originally mounted in the horizontal handscroll format. The extant text lists the disease-curing blessings promised to all who worship the Lotus Sutra and ends with the title. The sumptuous paper on which it is written exemplifies a Japanese fascination with sprinkled gold and silver decoration that found its ultimate expression in maki-e (sprinkled design) lacquer. Delicately painted lotus plants line the upper and lower edges of the composition. The lotus is the international symbol of the Buddhist faith, signifying the beauty and purity of the Buddha's teachings despite their origins in this impure world of illusions.","totaluniquepageviews":289,"exhibitioncount":3,"dimensions":"handscroll fragment only: H. 25 x W. 44 cm (9 13/16 x 17 5/16 in.)\r\nmounting, including cord and roller ends: 109.2 x 63.5 cm (43 x 25 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-09-17","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-07-26","dateend":1150,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

One side represents the contest-a boxing match-for which it was the prize. Along with the two nude boxers and a referee is a female figure identified as Olympias, the personification of the Olympic Games. The other side shows the goddess Athena, to whom the Panathenaic festival was dedicated. The inscriptions next to the columns indicate the festival (\"from the Games at Athens\") and the date (\"during the magistracy of Theophrastos\"), which is 340-339 BCE. Though the black-figure technique had long been eclipsed by red-figure, the former was still used on the Panathenaic amphorae, no doubt as an expression of the festival's antiquity. Similarly, Athena's pose and dress are consciously archaizing.\r\n\r\nAdditional information:\r\n\r\nDistinctive in shape and iconography, the amphora identifies itself through an inscription, painted vertically behind the standing figure of Athena: TON ATHENETHEN ATHLON ([I am] from the games at Athens). The first examples of this amphora type are associated with the reorganization of the Panathenaic Festival in 566 BCE, when athletic competitions were established, to be held by the Athenians every four years on the 28th of Hecatombaion (JulyAugust) at the events called the Greater Panathenaia. A Lesser Panathenaic festival was held annually in the intervening years. These celebrations were meant to mark the birth of Athena, patron goddess of the city. \r\n\r\nUnder the direction of the festivals officials, black-figure vases such as these, among some of the largest produced from the Athenian potters workshops, were filled with olive oil from the sacred trees of Athena and awarded as prizes for the particular athletic events depicted on the reverse side of the vases. Probably because of the conservative customs associated with this religious festival, Panathenaic amphorae remained relatively standard in shape and decoration, holding an average of about thirty-nine liters or one metretes, an Athenian unit of liquid measure, and were always decorated in the black-figure technique, long after that decoration had been abandoned for the red-figure style. Awarded as prizes in the games as late as the second century BCE, Panathenaic amphorae are testimony to the unique and enduring tradition of this Athenian festival and its prizes.","style":"Black-figure","datebegin":-340,"imagecount":12,"description":"Side A: Athena Promachos advancing to right clothed in an archaic Ionic chiton ornamented with a dotted border in white and provided with rudimentary sleeves ending in two swallow-tails thrown over each shoulder, Attic helmet with tall crest, and brandishing a spear in her right while covering herself with a shield which she holds in her left. Her head, helmet, and right hand project into the upper border.

The body sags to form a deep, rounded reservoir. The long neck curves forward, with crease marks shown in the skin. The head is in an unnatural position with the muzzle between the trussed forelegs. Body and thighs are stippled to indicate hair. Four grooves on the bulging sides indicate ribs or creases. The open eyes are large, with heavy, hooded lids; a rosette or curly forelock falls between them. Heavy tufts of hair are at the base of the large ears. Straight, spiraled horns extend back from the head and a large post rises between and slightly in front of them.\r\n\r\nOn the belly is a hinged, rectangular plate (2.5 cm x 1.6 cm), showing the genitals in relief; the surface is stippled, as is the rest of the animal's body. The plate, which is complete, partially covers a pour hole, presumably to permit the lamp to be filled while burning. The straight end of the plate forms the inner side of the wick hole, which is large (maximum internal width 2.9 cm; length 2.1 cm) and rounded.\r\n\r\nThe lamp stands on a tripod formed by three bent gazelle's legs, the flat, cloven hooves on square plates. Of these tripod legs, the proper left foreleg is modern. The gazelle's tail curves downward from under the nozzle and is attached to the bend of the tripod leg with a shell-like element, to form a suspension loop. A tube projects from the forehead. It has a finished edge into which a rod was inserted. The inner rod is broken off at the level of the outer, but by analogy with a group of similar lamps it was a long handle or suspension device terminating in a bird's head (1).\r\n\r\nThe lamp belongs to a group generally associated with Egypt and dated variously from the second century BCE through the second century CE, although only one example known to me comes from a dated context (2). The gazelle (dorcas) is a small genus of antelope known to Pliny and Aelian as native to North Africa and was a popular import to Rome (3). Roman mosaics and wall paintings usually show the captured animal in a net. In contrast, this lamp preserves an image that occurs throughout ancient Egyptian art, demonstrating that it continued in use into the Roman period and, in fact, into Coptic art (4).\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n1. M. Dodt, Eine bronze Öllampe mit Tierkopf aus Zülpich und ihre möglichen Vorbilder, Kölner Jahrbuch 33 (2000): 329-40, describes and illustrates five examples (Bonn, Rheinisches Landesmuseum inv. no. U1322; Cairo, Coptic Museum inv. no. JE38864; British Museum inv. no. Q3593; Louvre inv. no. N926; and Turin, Museo Egizio inv. no. 7198) and this piece, which he sees as forerunners of a lamp excavated in late Roman fill at ancient Zülpich. He believes they could be either censors or lamps (ibid., 340). In four examples the rod is attached to the back of the animal's neck; the example in the Louvre (ibid., 355, no. 5) has a similar tube within a tube rising from the forehead. Markings on the British museum example suggest to Dodt that the long rod was removable when the lamp stood on a table or stand (ibid., 338).\r\n\r\n2. See D. M. Bailey, A Catalogue of Lamps in the British Museum 4: Lamps of Metal and Stone, and Lampstands (London, 1996) 19, no. Q3593, pls. 18 and 183, dated first or second century CE and made in Egypt. For a dated context, see ibid., 50, no. Q3719AE, pl. 61, a non-representational deep, oval reservoir on three hoofed legs and having a rod-hook with duck head termination rising opposite the nozzle; excavated at Tanis in a context dated to the second half of the second century CE. Close to this is J. W. Hayes, Greek, Roman, and Related Metalware in the Royal Ontario Museum: A Catalogue (Toronto, 1984) 158-59, no. 247, an iron lamp from the Fayoum dated to the second to first century BCE. See also id., Ancient Lamps in the Royal Ontario Museum 1: Greek and Roman Clay Lamps: A Catalogue (Toronto, 1980) 40-41, nos. 192-94, pl. 20, clay derivatives of the same date also from the Fayoum.\r\n\r\n3. J. M. C. Toynbee, Animals in Roman Life and Art (Baltimore, 1996) 145-47. One of the hunt scenes in the wall paintings at the monastery of St. Apollo at Bawit shows a gazelle hunt; see A. Badaway, Coptic Art and Archaeology: The Art of the Christian Egyptians from the Late Antique to the Middle Ages (Cambridge, MA, 1978) 248, fig. 4.24.\r\n\r\n4. D. G. Mitten believes that Harvard's lamp is later than the examples cited above and puts it in the fourth century CE; see D. G. Mitten and A. Brauer, Dialogue with Antiquity: The Curatorial Achievement of George M. A. Hanfmann, exh. cat., Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University (Cambridge, MA, 1982) no. 56. The interesting lamp in the form of a bound bull from Edfu cited by H. Hoffmann, The Beauty of Ancient Art: Classical Antiquity, Near East, Egypt, exh. cat., Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University (Mainz, 1964) no. 101 is now illustrated in P. Labib and V. Girgis, The Coptic Museum and the Fortress of Babylon at Old Cairo (Cairo, 1975) 12, pl. 25, dated from the fifth-sixth centuries CE. Badaway 1978 (supra 3) 321-32, gives examples of the inventiveness and delight in theriomorphic forms for bronze makers of Roman Egypt, among which he cites an open lamp with volute nozzles having a rod-hook supported by dolphins (ibid., figs. 5.6, 5.12) and a lamp in Turin, also noted by Dodt 2000 (supra 1). He does not date these examples but discusses them in the context of 5th-6th century items. However, the Turin lamp lacks the naturalism and careful surface detailing of the Harvard piece.\r\n\r\n\r\nJane Ayer Scott\r\n\r\n","dateoflastpageview":"2014-08-11","dateoffirstpageview":"2010-11-30","primaryimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:DDC250936_dynmc","dated":"2nd-4th century CE","contextualtextcount":0,"copyright":null,"period":"Roman Imperial period","url":"http://harvardartmuseums.org/art/311074","provenance":"Mr. and Mrs. Norbert Schimmel, Long Island, NY, (by 1964), gift; to the Fogg Art Museum, 1968.","publicationcount":5,"images":[{"baseimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:DDC250936_dynmc","primarydisplay":1,"publiccaption":null,"copyright":"President and Fellows of Harvard College","renditionnumber":"DDC250936"},{"baseimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:DDC251016_dynmc","primarydisplay":0,"publiccaption":null,"copyright":"President and Fellows of Harvard College","renditionnumber":"DDC251016"},{"baseimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:STR017814","primarydisplay":0,"publiccaption":null,"copyright":"President and Fellows of Harvard College","renditionnumber":"STR017814"},{"baseimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:DDC251017_dynmc","primarydisplay":0,"publiccaption":null,"copyright":"President and Fellows of Harvard College","renditionnumber":"DDC251017"},{"baseimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:DDC251088_dynmc","primarydisplay":0,"publiccaption":"Detail of spout","copyright":"President and Fellows of Harvard College","renditionnumber":"DDC251088"},{"baseimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:DDC251018_dynmc","primarydisplay":0,"publiccaption":null,"copyright":"President and Fellows of Harvard College","renditionnumber":"DDC251018"},{"baseimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:STR017813","primarydisplay":0,"publiccaption":null,"copyright":"President and Fellows of Harvard College","renditionnumber":"STR017813"},{"baseimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:40887_dynmc","primarydisplay":0,"publiccaption":null,"copyright":"President and Fellows of Harvard College","renditionnumber":"40887"},{"baseimageurl":"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:40889_dynmc","primarydisplay":0,"publiccaption":null,"copyright":"President and Fellows of Harvard College","renditionnumber":"40889"}],"objectid":311074,"culture":"Roman","standardreferencenumber":null,"worktypes":[{"worktype":"lighting device"}],"department":"Department of Ancient and Byzantine Art & Numismatics","state":null,"markscount":0,"contact":"am_asianmediterranean@harvard.edu","titlescount":1,"id":311074,"title":"Lamp in the Shape of a Trussed Male Gazelle","verificationlevel":3,"division":"Asian and Mediterranean Art","details":{"technical":{"text":"ICP-MS sample, Leaded Bronze:\r\nCu, 66.64; Sn, 7.36; Pb, 25.42; Zn, 0.009; Fe, 0.07; Ni, 0.04; Ag, 0.04; Sb, 0.06; As, 0.31; Bi, less than 0.025; Co, 0.061; Au, less than 0.01; Cd, less than 0.001\r\nJ.

Patches of a thick, red cuprite layer and a green corrosion layer are present in many areas and are convincing evidence of long-term burial. In 2013, a sample was drilled from the inner side of the right arm near the shoulder and revealed a significant cuprite layer that was not entirely visible on the surface.\r\n \r\nThe legs and feet below the knees are modern cast bronze restorations. Small ridges in some areas of the original corrosion layers are the result of the original cleaning, which appears to have been accomplished by scraping. A later cleaning in 1970, done to reveal details of the face, exposed bright metal that is now inpainted.\r\n \r\nThe bronze is solid cast, probably by a lost-wax technique. There is no indication that the wax model was cast or entirely formed directly in the wax. If an indirect technique was used to cast the model, the fine detail in the head and torso were likely refined by working directly on the surface of the wax cast. Larger locks of the figures hair appear to be modeled in the wax; finer incised lines on the locks are cold worked into the surface of the bronze cast. Circular depressions to the left and right side of each eye, which were exposed in the 1970 cleaning of the head, serve to define the shape of the eyeball. The condition of the surface around the eyes makes it impossible to say whether these features were made in the bronze or in the wax model. Although they have been described as drill holes, there is no visual evidence that a drilling process was involved. A slight depression behind the copious locks of hair at the periphery could have once held a fillet, wreath, or crown, but the contour is so faint that it is equally possible that no such element existed, and no means of attachment for such a component is visible. The hole in the left hand for the lance is open at both ends. It is plugged at the center with what appears to be burial accretions.\r\n \r\n \r\nHenry Lie 4/2001, updated 2013","type":"Technical Observations"}},"style":null,"commentary":null,"relatedcount":0,"datebegin":117,"totaluniquepageviews":116,"dimensions":"12.1 x 5.3 x 3.6 cm (4 3/4 x 2 1/16 x 1 7/16 in.)","exhibitioncount":4,"dateend":217,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

By contrast, the visual arts of a given culture sometimes reveal a different picture of how a particular faith is lived and experienced by its adher¬ents. This limestone slab and the adjacent ceramic plaque do both: The inscriptions framing the top and sides of each object replicate verses from the Quran, Islams central text, and the beautifully carved inscription in an ornamental Arabic script identifies the stone slab as a qabr, or grave marker. The turquoise plaque was probably created for a mausoleum. The various schools of Islamic jurisprudence (fikh) are unanimous in disapproving of all tomb ornamenta¬tion. As the many decorated tombstones and mausolea throughout Islamic lands demonstrate, however, this was a law sometimes honored in the breach.\r\n","style":null,"datebegin":1117,"imagecount":1,"description":null,"totaluniquepageviews":34,"exhibitioncount":9,"dimensions":"46 x 26 x 4.5 cm (18 1/8 x 10 1/4 x 1 3/4 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-08-13","dateoffirstpageview":"2010-01-25","dateend":1117,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.

Nurhan Atasoy and Julian Raby (Iznik 1989) call this \"The Saz Leaf and Rosette Style\" after the essential motifs in the designs. Atasoy and Raby link this phase to the influence of the artist Sahkulu, who headed the atelier of the Ottoman court designers (cemaat-i nakkasan) from 1526 until his death in 1556. Earlier scholars, following the lead of Arthur Lane (Ars Orientalis, 1957), refer to this as the \"Damascus Phase\" of Iznik pottery. Lane's Damascus Phase is broader than Atasoy and Raby's Saz Leaf and Rosette Style, extending from c. 1525-55, for he focused less on specific motifs than on the distinctive palette of cobalt, turquoise, sage-green, and purple. The most sensitive drawing and the full palette appear on vessels. By contrast, tiles, which are quite rare for this phase/style, are only painted in cobalt and turquoise, and their drawing betrays somewhat the effect of mass production. \r\n\r\nSources for the saz style in Ottoman art can be found in fifteenth-century Persian drawings. Sahkulu (Shah Quli) himself was a Tabrizi.\r\n \r\nIdentical tiles are found in the collections of the British Museum (OA92 6-13 69) and the Victoria and Albert Museum (1680.1892), gifted to these institutions in 1892 by Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks (1826-97), celebrated English antiquary, collector, and a major figure in the history of the British Museum. \r\n\r\nThe British Museum tile is published in: \t\r\n\tJ.

The green is very compact and preserves surface detail. The empress weight is slightly grayer in tone, and this slight difference could be important in relating the three components. On the other hand, variations in the choice of alloy for the figural cast weight could easily have caused this difference. The dissimilarity between the color of the mixed copper alloy weight and the very dark brass hook connected to the single chain link at the crown stands out, and the hook could have been added at a later date or come from another object.\r\n \r\nMost of the weight-bearing surfaces show a similar (and significant) degree of ancient wear. The retaining pin and ring for the third hook, now missing from the crossbeam, are made of iron rather than copper alloy, as in the other two, intact hooks. Perhaps this was a replacement (using a tougher, longer-lasting metal, although one more prone to corrosion) after the original copper alloy pin and ring failed. As suggested above, the flat profile hook attached to the weight, with its different patina, could also be a replacement, although possibly an ancient one. Its flat profile and sharp bearing edge are appropriate for precise measurement, and it would have seen the most aggressive and abrasive use of all the components, explaining the need to replace it during the original period of use. The lead and corroded iron inside the empress weight are intact and appear to be antique. The weight exhibits the dents and wear that would be expected from use. \r\n \r\nThe weight was cast, but areas of surface relief appear to have been enhanced with a file after casting. The chains were cold worked from a bronze rod, and the hooks and the crossbeam were probably cast as general shapes and then cold worked to receive their final shape and surface detail. Punches were used to make the scale markings on the crossbeam. \r\n \r\n \r\nHenry Lie 4/11/2006","type":"Technical Observations"}},"style":null,"commentary":"Re-View Exhibition, Spring 2008, gallery label information:\r\n\r\nSteelyard: Empress Bust Weight,\r\nCrossbeam, and Collar with Chains\r\nByzantine, 5th-7th century AD\r\nBronze, lead\r\nArthur M.

Sackler Museum, Ernest B. and Helen Pratt Dane Fund for the Acquisition of Oriental Art, 1990.1\r\n\r\nIn the early centuries of the medieval period, Kashmir was a flourishing center of Hindu and Buddhist practices where several cults developed, including localized forms of Shaivism, the worship of the Hindu god Shiva. This work depicts a common icon in the Kashmiri Shaivite tradition, a three-headed form of Shiva known as Maheshvara (great lord). His smooth, rounded form, squat proportions, and flattened features closely resemble the artistic style that developed just before and during the rule of the Kashmiri king Avantivarman (r. c. 85583). Kashmir was at the cross¬roads between India and the provincial Hellenistic region of Gandhara to the north. The suggestion of musculature in Shivas torso reveals the lingering influence of Gandharan styles upon Kashmiri art.\r\n","style":null,"datebegin":700,"imagecount":7,"description":null,"totaluniquepageviews":192,"exhibitioncount":1,"dimensions":"66.7 x 25.2 x 11.4 cm (26 1/4 x 9 15/16 x 4 1/2 in.)","dateoflastpageview":"2014-09-15","dateoffirstpageview":"2009-05-26","dateend":900,"creditline":"Harvard Art Museums/Arthur M.
